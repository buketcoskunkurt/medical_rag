It is a pathology with a favorable evolution, but with frequent recurrences (which imply an economic extra cost). The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of physiotherapy treatment for the treatment of epicondylitis and, if any, to identify the most appropriate techniques. A systematic search was carried out in October 2020 in the databases of PubMed, Cinahl, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science using the search terms: Physical therapy modalities, Physical and rehabilitation medicine, Rehabilitation, Tennis elbow and Elbow tendinopathy. Nineteen articles were found, of which seven applied shock waves, three applied orthoses, three applied different manual therapy techniques, two applied some kind of bandage, one applied therapeutic exercise, one applied diacutaneous fibrolysis, one applied high intensity laser, and one applied vibration. Manual therapy and eccentric strength training are the two physiotherapeutic treatment methods that have the greatest beneficial effects, and, furthermore, their cost-benefit ratio is very favorable. Its complementation with other techniques, such as shock waves, bandages or Kinesio® taping, among others, facilitates the achievement of therapeutic objectives, but entails an added cost.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34397403/"}

A best-evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results of the included studies (2 reviews and 22 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). For physical therapy, moderate evidence was found for myofascial massage therapy versus ischemic compression on latent, or active, trigger points or low-level laser therapy in the short term. For several electrophysical modalities, moderate evidence was found in the short term (ultrasound vs placebo, ultrasound as single intervention vs other nonsurgical interventions, ultrasound vs corticosteroid injection plus a neutral wrist splint, local microwave hyperthermia vs placebo, iontophoresis vs phonophoresis, pulsed radiofrequency added to wrist splint, continuous vs pulsed vs placebo shortwave diathermy, and interferential current vs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation vs a night-only wrist splint). In the midterm, moderate evidence was found in favor of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) added to a neutral wrist splint, in favor of ESWT versus ultrasound, or cryo-ultrasound, and in favor of ultrasound versus placebo. For all other interventions studied, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found. No RCTs investigating the long-term effects of physical therapy and electrophysical modalities were found. Because of heterogeneity in the treatment parameters used in the included RCTs, optimal treatment parameters could not be identified.

TU uses sound waves to produce both thermal and nonthermal effects that aid in tissue healing, repair, and function. TENS uses different frequencies of electrical current to decrease pain and inflammation. NMES also uses an electrical current to stimulate muscle contraction to assist in normal neuromuscular function in postorthopedic and neurological injuries. LLLT uses light energy to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and stimulate healing at a cellular level. PMF uses magnetic field to stimulate normal cellular ion exchange and oxygen utilization and promote generalized healing of tissues. These modalities are discussed in detail covering mechanism of action, parameters, settings, and indications/contraindications of use in our small animals.

Systematic searches were conducted in 5 bibliographic databases. The studies selected presented quantitative data related to the care of patients with MSKD by physical therapists in an ED setting. Raters reviewed studies and used the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool to assess their methodological quality. Fifteen studies were included. Two studies, 1 of weak and 1 of strong quality, demonstrated that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as or more effective than usual medical care for pain reduction, and 6 studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as usual care in EDs in reducing disability. Eight studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care could significantly reduce waiting time in EDs. Four studies of varying quality reported that physical therapists ordered no more, or even fewer, medical images than physicians. In terms of health care costs, 2 studies of moderate to high quality found no significant differences in costs between physical therapist care and usual care in EDs. Finally, 6 studies of varying quality reported that patients were as satisfied or more satisfied with physical therapist care as with usual medical care in EDs.

A summary of the efficacy of a range of physical treatments is provided in Table 1. The evidence-based primary care options are exercise, laser, massage, and spinal manipulation; however, the latter three have small or transient effects that limit their value as therapies for chronic LBP. In contrast, exercise produces large reductions in pain and disability, a feature that suggests that exercise should play a major role in the management of chronic LBP. Physical treatments, such as acupuncture, backschool, hydrotherapy, lumbar supports, magnets, TENS, traction, ultrasound, Pilates therapy, Feldenkrais therapy, Alexander technique, and craniosacral therapy are either of unknown value or ineffective and so should not be considered. Outside of primary care, multidisciplinary treatment or functional restoration is effective; however, the high cost probably means that these programs should be reserved for patients who do not respond to cheaper treatment options for chronic LBP. Although there are now effective treatment options for chronic LBP, it needs to be acknowledged that the problem of chronic LBP is far from solved. Though treatments can provide marked improvements in the patient's condition, the available evidence suggests that the typical chronic LBP patient is left with some residual pain and disability.

Current physiotherapies provide limited recovery. Orthoses substitute for ankle strength, but they provide no lasting therapeutic effect. Brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a novel rehabilitative approach that may generate permanent neurological improvements. This study explores the safety and feasibility of a foot-drop-targeted BCI-FES physiotherapy in chronic stroke survivors. Subjects (n = 9) operated an electroencephalogram-based BCI-FES system for foot dorsiflexion in 12 one-hour sessions over four weeks. Gait speed, dorsiflexion active range of motion (AROM), six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and Fugl-Meyer leg motor (FM-LM) scores were assessed before, during, and after therapy. The primary safety outcome measure was the proportion of subjects that deteriorated in gait speed by ≥0.16 m/s at one week or four weeks post-therapy. The secondary outcome measures were the proportion of subjects that experienced a clinically relevant decrease in dorsiflexion AROM (≥2.5°), 6MWD (≥20 %), and FM-LM score (≥10 %) at either post-therapy assessment. No subjects (0/9) experienced a clinically significant deterioration in gait speed, dorsiflexion AROM, 6MWT distance, or FM-LM score at either post-therapy assessment. Five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥0.06 m/s) in gait speed, three subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥2.5°) in dorsiflexion AROM, five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥10 %) in 6MWD, and three subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥10 %) in FM-LM. Five of the six subjects that exhibited a detectable increase in either post-therapy gait speed or 6MWD also exhibited significant (p < 0.01 using a Mann-Whitney U test) increases in electroencephalogram event-related synchronization/desynchronization. Additionally, two subjects experienced a clinically important increase (≥0.16 m/s) in gait speed, and four subjects experienced a clinically important increase (≥20 %) in 6MWD. Linear mixed models of gait speed, dorsiflexion AROM, 6MWD, and FM-LM scores suggest that BCI-FES therapy is associated with an increase in lower motor performance at a statistically, yet not clinically, significant level. BCI-FES therapy is safe. If it is shown to improve post-stroke gait function in future studies, it could provide a new gait rehabilitation option for severely impaired patients.

It is argued that there is a place for electrophysical modalities in contemporary practice, and several basic principles are considered together with more specific information regarding two modalities namely, ultrasound and interferential therapy. Electrophysical agents are utilised to bring about physiological effects, and it is these changes which bring about the therapeutic benefit rather than the modality itself. Clinical decision protocols employing the available evidence should enable the most appropriate modality to be employed for a particular patient. Indiscriminate use of electrotherapy is unlikely to yield significant benefit, however used at the right time, it has the potential to achieve beneficial effect. The patient management programme which combines manual therapy, exercise therapy and electrotherapy, based on current evidence, should enable the most efficacious management of a patients' dysfunction.

A computer-aided and manual search for published RCTs investigating treatment and prevention of SUI using physical therapies, e.g. pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises, with or without other treatment modalities, were carried out. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using criteria based on generally accepted principles of interventional research. Twenty-four RCTs (22 treatment and two prevention) were identified; the methodological quality of the studies included was moderate and 11 RCTs were of sufficient quality to be included in further analysis. Based on levels-of-evidence criteria, there is strong evidence to suggest that PFM exercises are effective in reducing the symptoms of SUI. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of high-intensity vs a low-intensity regimen of PFM exercises. Despite significant effects of biofeedback after testing as an adjunct to PFM exercises, there is no evidence that PFM exercises with biofeedback are more effective than PFM exercises alone. There is little consistency (of stimulation types and parameters) in the studies of electrical stimulation, but when the results are combined there is strong evidence to suggest that electrostimulation is superior to sham electrostimulation, and limited evidence that there is no difference between electrostimulation and other physical therapies.

Within the physiotherapy market, firms participate in competitive bidding, prices are determined by the market, services are free at the point of use and firms are allowed to react to patient choice only by enhancing quality. Firm-level data (n = 854) regarding quality and price were analysed. Using 2SLS estimation techniques, we analysed the relationship between quality and competition, and price and competition. Our study found that competition has a negative (yet weak) effect on quality. Prices on the other hand are not affected by competition. The result is likely caused by imperfect information, because it seems that the Social Insurance Institution of Finland has provided too little information for patients to make adequate choices about proper service providers. We argue that by publishing quality information, it is possible to ease the decision-making of patients and influence the quality strategies of firms active in the physiotherapy market. Moreover, we found that competition appeared as an exogenous variable in this study. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27619843/"}

To study the parameters of the activity of physiotherapy units of treatment-and-prophylactic facilities in the Irkutsk Region to assess the dynamics of their development and further prospects. The authors analyzed the data of state statistical annual reporting on the work of physiotherapy departments (PTDs) and physiotherapy rooms (PTRs), which had been submitted to the Medical Information Analysis Center, Ministry of Health of the Irkutsk Region, and information on physiotherapeutic medical care in the treatment-and-prophylactic facilities of the Irkutsk Region in the period 2010 to 2017. The quantitative indicators of the activities of PTD and PTR employees were investigated; the qualitative components of their activities were assessed; the problems of physiotherapeutic management were revealed and the ways of their solution were defined. Since 2014, there have been negative changes in the development of physiotherapy: the material and technical base is worsening; the number of doctors and nurses is being reduced; the specialists' qualification is decreasing, and the coverage of patients with physiotherapies is reducing. Physiotherapy is currently undergoing a period of stagnation. Along with the existing systemic economic problems of modern public health, the deepening of this negative situation in physiotherapy is promoted by the protracted period of the formation of the new specialty of physical and rehabilitation medicine physician, the absence of its legal base, federal state educational standards, which creates a number of misunderstandings of its promises and demand for physiotherapists in near future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32592574/"}

{"id": "12217065", "title": "Professional responsibility in relation to cervical spine manipulation.", "text": "Manipulation of the cervical spine is one of the few potentially life-threatening procedures performed by physiotherapists. Is it worth the risk? A comparison of risks versus benefits indicates that at present, the risks of cervical manipulation outweigh the benefits: manipulation has yet to be shown to be more effective for neck pain and headache than other interventions such as mobilisation, whereas the risks, although infrequent, are serious. This analysis is of particular concern because the conditions for which manipulation is indicated are benign and usually self-limiting. Because physiotherapists have legal and ethical obligations to the community to avoid foreseeable harm and provide optimum care, it may be prudent to determine who in our profession should perform cervical manipulation. That is, the profession could restrict the practice of cervical spine manipulation. Although all registered physiotherapists in Australia are entitled to perform cervical manipulation, few choose to use this intervention. Therefore, it might be feasible to encourage those practitioners who wish to use cervical manipulation to undertake formal education programs. Such a requirement could be embodied in a code of practice that discourages those without formal training from performing cervical manipulation. By taking such measures, we could ensure that our profession exercises wisdom in its monitoring and use of cervical manipulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12217065/"}

The physiotherapy followed a typical British approach, which is Bobath derived. Ten hours of additional therapy were given over a 5-week period. The study design was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Stroke patients were recruited from those admitted to the hospital in the 5 weeks after stroke. They were randomly allocated to routine physiotherapy, additional treatment by a qualified physiotherapist, or additional treatment by a physiotherapy assistant. Outcome was assessed after 5 weeks of treatment and at 3 and 6 months after stroke on measures of arm function and of independence in activities of daily living. There were 282 patients recruited to the study. The median initial Barthel score was 6.5, and the median age of the patients was 73 years. The median initial Rivermead Motor Assessment Arm score was 1. There were no significant differences between the groups at randomization or on any of the outcome measures.

Use of strategies and specific training for physiotherapists may be needed before approaches like activity coaching can be adopted successfully.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23896335/"}

This study also explored the PTs delivery of these BCTs beyond the present or absent dichotomy, using a third variable, partial delivery (i.e., attempted). Assessment of the intervention arm of the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) cluster, randomized controlled feasibility trial, using quantitative methods. Eight PTs delivered six SOLAS classes each, of which 50% were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by two raters using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 and an intervention-specific manual and assessed for the delivery (i.e., full, partial, or absent) of the 31 BCTs and their target behaviours. Fidelity was calculated as fully delivered BCTs listed as a percentage of those due to take place within each class. Physiotherapists delivered a mean 20.5 BCTs per class (68.3%; range = 64.9-72.4%). Of these, 17 BCTs were fully delivered in each class representing moderate fidelity to the protocol (56.8%; range = 53.5-59.3%). A further 3.5 BCTs per class (11.5%; range = 8.7-14.8%) were partially delivered. BCTs associated with 'goals and planning' were often poorly delivered. Delivering the SOLAS intervention BCTs with high fidelity was not feasible. The assessment of partial delivery of BCTs provided greater insight into the techniques that should be removed from the protocol or that may require further training. Complex interventions should consider a list of 'core' or mandatory BCTs alongside 'optional' BCTs, depending on the target behaviour, and the needs of individual participants. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? BCTs are the smallest active components of behavioural interventions, yet typically their effectiveness is determined through meta-analyses. Attempted delivery of BCTs is often unaccounted for yet may provide valuable insight into difficulty with delivery. There is a need to investigate BCT implementation beyond simple presence/absence to identify protocol refinements or required BCT training. What does this study add? BCT delivery was assessed in greater depth than previous research, including partial delivery. Highlights the need for appropriate training in BCTs that are difficult to deliver, particularly those associated with 'goals and planning' Highlights the need for intervention-specific criteria as to what constitutes 'high', 'moderate', and 'low' fidelity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888520/"}

A qualitative, descriptive, comparative approach was used. Nine patients and 10 physiotherapists participated. Data from observations and semi-structured interviews were used. Six themes were identified: setting and attaining goals, focusing on motor activity, finding the optimal training strategy, facilitating active patient involvement, making use of environmental factors and adjusting to the structural reorganization of the rehabilitation services. The physiotherapists and the patients made similar descriptions in some of the themes but differed in some. The physiotherapists expressed what they perceived to be their lack of scientific knowledge, while the patients trusted their physiotherapists' competence. The physiotherapists wanted to take the patients' personal experiences into account in the sessions, which was not obvious to the patients. Differences in physiotherapists' and patients' descriptions of characteristics of physiotherapy sessions have to be taken into consideration in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.

The understanding of the mode of action regarding physiotherapeutic methods with analgetic effects is due to the knowledge about the pathophysiologic relationship between inflammation and pain. On one hand, the information of pain from the periphery causes a sensibilisation of central nervous areas and therefore allodynia as well as irradiation of the painful area. On the other hand, biochemical processes lead to a neurogenic and alogenic inflammation due to the impact on the pain nerves. Beside the arthritis itself, the physiotherapy of a rheumatic-inflamed painful joint has to take into account the components arthralgia, irritation of the capsula, periarthropathia, and allogenic inflammation. Physiotherapeutic pain treatment has three modes of action: a causal effect on the structural level, suppression of over-excitation of the tissue as well as the central nervous transmission areas, and activation of the decelerating pain modulating systems. Each treatment procedure with analgetic effects like cooling, heating, localized mechanical methods, the activation techniques with proprio- and exteroceptive effects (TENS, Maitland-mobilisation), the electrotherapeutic option, and physical training therapy is characterized with its specific mode of action. The dosage of physiotherapeutic techniques has to be taken into account since it has to remain within physiologic limits and the tissue's irritability must not be reached.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10478427/"}

Although clinical guidelines for best practice have been developed recently, there has been no large-scale attempt to describe current physiotherapeutic treatment approaches within Britain or Ireland. After semi-structured interviews (n = 6) and two pilot studies (n = 77) were done, postal questionnaires were distributed to four regional cluster samples of the membership of two physiotherapy professional organizations (n = 2654). After two mailings, a random sample of 90 nonresponders were followed up. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Ltd., Woking, Surrey, UK), and precision of the survey estimates was assessed by calculation of sampling errors and intraclass correlation coefficients for cluster sampling. Results were received from 1548 therapists (total response rate, 58.3%); of these, 813 reported that they were practicing in settings in which they treated patients with low back pain. Analysis of the results indicated the overall popularity of the Maitland mobilization and McKenzie approaches among physiotherapists. Although exercise per se was mentioned frequently by respondents, a marked difference in opinion among therapists regarding the optimal type of exercise for low back pain was obvious. Little evidence was demonstrated of the use of manipulation, fitness programs, or multidisciplinary efforts involving behavioral and physical aspects of treatment.

This study therefore aimed to explore with experienced therapists firstly how the Bobath concept had changed since 1990, and secondly what they considered its main theoretical assumptions to be using a focus group research design. Eight peer-nominated expert physiotherapists agreed to participate in two focus groups organized according to specialist interest in either neurology (group A) or elderly care (group B). Therapists were asked to discuss six topics based on a review of published literature. Data analysis involved several readings of verbatim transcriptions, from which key themes and concepts were developed. All therapists agreed on the following core themes defining Bobath: analysis of normal movement, control of tone and facilitation of movement. Neuroplasticity was described as the primary rationale for treatment with therapists using afferent information to target the damaged central nervous system. In addition group A discussed motor learning, whereas group B discussed patient focused goals and relating treatment to function. This study highlighted changes in theory, terminology, and techniques. Tone remained a major problem in the rehabilitation management of the hemiplegic patient; however much attention was also directed towards the musculoskeletal system. Both facilitation of normal movement components and task specific practice using specific manual guidance were considered critical elements of the Bobath concept. For Bobath therapists, physiotherapy has an important impact on both the performance components of movement and functional outcomes. In view of the small numbers involved in this preliminary study, further studies are now needed to determine if these themes and concepts are congruent with the majority of physiotherapists' interpretation of the Bobath concept in stroke rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087062/"}

The inventory was administered by phone to organizations and groups identified as meeting the definition of a community-based resource. One hundred and six CBR informants were interviewed, each reporting one or two recreational activities provided at their site. The activities included arts, sports, or leisure offerings, with a total of 127 activities identified in the sample. The results of the study support the premise that community-based resources are receptive to providing activities for children with physical disabilities and to potential collaboration with therapists.

Descriptive analyses indicated high frequency use of exercise therapy, manipulation, heat packs, massage and ultrasound. Multidimensional scaling revealed a clear structure concerning combination use of techniques, and a coherent typology based on this usage.

Two-hundred-fifty subjects (68 females, 182 males; ages 34-51 years) with CLBP following an L5 laminectomy were randomly assigned into five separate groups for a treatment period of 8 weeks. Chronic low back pain status was measured by modified-modified Schober, Cybex Liftask, and Oswestry procedures. Results revealed that: 1) only low-tech and high-tech exercise produced significant improvements (p < .05) in CLBP, 2) the mean period of CLBP relief ranged from 1.6 weeks (control) to 91.4 weeks (low-tech exercise), and 3) low-tech exercise was most cost-effective. It was concluded that: 1) low-tech and high-tech exercise were the only effective treatments for CLBP, 2) low-tech exercise produced the longest period of CLBP relief, and 3) low-tech exercise was the most cost-effective form of treatment.

Existing economic evaluations of interventions to manage frailty have limited time horizons, but even in older populations there may be important longer-term differences in costs and outcomes. This paper reports on the development of a cost-effectiveness model to predict publicly funded health and aged care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the remaining lifetime of frail Australians and a model-based cost-utility analysis of a physiotherapy-based intervention for frail individuals. A cohort-based state transition (Markov) model was developed to predict costs and QALYs over the remaining lifetime of a frail population. Frailty is defined using the phenotypic definition of frailty, and the model comprises health states that describe frailty status, residential status, the experience of bone fractures and depression, and death. Model input parameters were estimated and calibrated using the Dynamic Analyses to Optimise Ageing dataset, supplemented with data from the published literature. The cost-effectiveness model was subject to a range of validation approaches, which did not negate the validity of the model. The evaluated physiotherapy-based frailty intervention has an expected incremental cost per QALY gained of Australian $8129 compared to usual care, but there is a probability of 0.3 that usual care is more effective and less costly than the intervention. Frailty reduces quality of life, is costly to manage and it's prevalence is increasing, but new approaches to managing frailty need to demonstrate value for money. The value of the reported cost-effectiveness model is illustrated through the estimation of all important costs and effects of a physiotherapy-based frailty intervention, which facilitates comparisons with funding decisions for other new technologies in Australia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28349499/"}

This approach seeks to embed the grievous wounds patients have sustained along a trajectory of injured to well. Patients are often eager to adopt this approach to their injury but in many cases find that the linear flow of time, upon which this clinical approach relies, is not matched by their experience. Instead the past, the present, and the future can flow together so that patients are simultaneously experiencing these three time orientations.

Based on the register of the Verband Deutscher Rentenversicherungsträger (Federation of German Pension Insurance Institutes), 433 health resort clinics were surveyed by mail in 1978/79 in order to obtain information on their sport and kinesiotherapy situations. The present findings are based on the replies of 206 clinics, corresponding to 55 percent (i.e. 39,840 beds) of the initial total of beds. The majority of patients covered suffered from disorders of inner organ function (66 percent) or from musculo-sceletal impairments (22 percent). Actual delivery of the sport and kinesiotherapy programmes lies with massage and balneology personnel in 60 percent, physiotherapists and gymnastics teachers in 32 percent of cases, and only in some 2.5 percent are the measures implemented by qualified sport teachers. The question is discussed whether these percentages are compatible with the health educational goals of present-day concepts for preventive or rehabilitative medical treatment in the health resort clinics. Changes are needed both at the staffing and organisational levels (staffing schedules, space allotment) if the pension insurance institutes' approach of \"health do it yourself\" is to prove successful in this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7221174/"}

The very weakest group is unable to make use of existing offers of rehabilitation. The objective of the investigation was to develop and test a model for functional training of weak, elderly people in their own home. The process was assessed in eight cases. The elderly were selected consecutively on discharge from two geriatric wards as those who could be rehabilitated, but who were too weak to undergo the usual process. Training was supported by the regular home help assigned to the old person and carried out under the supervision of a geriatrician and a physiotherapist. An external-qualitative evaluation of the programme is published elsewhere. In collaboration with the elderly people and the home help, the project team succeeded in forming and implementing a training scheme based on the expectations that the elderly people had to rehabilitation. Of the eight patients taking part in the investigation, five realised their wishes for a greater degree of mobility and for being able to get out-of-doors. The model developed, where the home help acts as the central figure in the implementation of the rehabilitation of enfeebled, old persons under the supervision of a physiotherapist and a geriatrician, is an interesting alternative to the existing programmes for rehabilitation of elderly people in their own home.

Owing to a lack of scientific reporting of modality usage, particularly within Canada, it was the purpose of this study to survey all private practitioners registered within the Province of Alberta. A total of 208 clinicians representing 41% of the population sample, responded to the survey. Results indicated hot packs followed by ultrasound, ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential were the most frequently used modalities. With the exception of ultrasound, these findings differed considerably from previous reports of modality usage. Statistical comparisons, using Fisher's exact test of independence, revealed frequent use of TENS was greater amongst older clinicians and clinic owners (p < 0.05) while male therapists used biofeedback more often than female colleagues (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between therapists trained at the University of Alberta and those educated elsewhere. Peer influence within the geographically and politically defined sample population may explain the relatively few between-group differences.

Building on the broader discourse on sustainable development, sustainability is used in relation to social, ecological, and economic concerns with varying degrees of emphasis and often related to a sense of durability. To provide a detailed analysis of the concept of sustainability in current physical therapy literature and advance its deliberate future implementation. Setting out from a critical exposition of prevalent models of sustainability, we conducted a critical discourse analysis to (1) examine the implementation of the concept of sustainability in physical therapy academic literature and (2) critically evaluate its hitherto use in light of the broader discourse surrounding sustainability. Our analysis identified a focus on the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions, and the use of so-called \"weak\" and \"strong sustainability\" models in the physical therapy literature. Other models and the broader critical discourse surrounding sustainability are only gradually finding their way into physical therapy literature. Physical therapy lacks comprehensive exploration of both general and profession-specific understandings of sustainability. Nuanced engagement with sustainability and its alternatives is necessary to ensure its meaningful implementation in physical therapy research, education, and practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39186496/"}
{"id": "3051257", "title": "Electromyostimulation from a clinical perspective. A review.", "text": "A proliferation of the research analysis and clinical use of electromyostimulation has occurred in sports medicine in the last decade. This manuscript will review the important findings from a clinical perspective. Specifically, this article will address the advantages of electromyostimulation over voluntary exercise indicating its greater effectiveness in the early period of rehabilitation when reflex inhibition is dominant. Other advantages of electromyostimulation include its: usefulness in training one component of an agonist muscle group; effectiveness during joint immobilisation; and possible role in altering specific muscle fibre types and enzymes. In order to facilitate the use of electromyostimulation a number of factors require consideration including proper selection of stimulus parameters, joint position and electrode size, type and placement. In addition, the research findings relative to the use of electromyostimulation at different stages of recovery as well as the concern of whether electromyostimulation should be used with or without voluntary activation of the muscle are addressed. There have been few clinical studies of the use of electromyostimulation after peripheral joint injury. The studies that have been performed focus primarily on quadriceps femoris rehabilitation after knee injury and these were classified according to diagnostic groups and discussed in this article. Finally, directions for future research are described with the hope that the great scientific effort displayed to date will be continued.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3051257/"}

Essential in the application of forced expiratory manoeuvres to improve mucus transport is whether airway compression should be used or prevented. The variables that influence the localization and degree of airway compression are expiratory force, lung volume and possibly mouth pressure.

{"id": "14567204", "title": "Physical modalities in chronic pain management.", "text": "The following conclusions can be made based on review of the evidence: There is limited but positive evidence that select physical modalities are effective in managing chronic pain associated with specific conditions experienced by adults and older individuals. Overall, studies have provided the most support for the modality of therapeutic exercise. Different physical modalities have similar magnitudes of effects on chronic pain. Therefore, selection of the most appropriate physical modality may depend on the desired functional outcome for the patient, the underlying impairment, and the patient's preference or prior experience with the modality. Certain patient characteristics may decrease the effectiveness of physical modalities, as has been seen with TENS. These characteristics include depression, high trait anxiety, a powerful others locus of control, obesity, narcotic use, and neuroticism. The effect on pain by various modalities is generally strongest in the short-term period immediately after the intervention series, but effects can last as long as 1 year after treatment (e.g., with massage). Most research has tested the effect of physical modalities on chronic low back pain and knee OA. The effectiveness of physical modalities for other chronic pain conditions needs to be evaluated more completely. Older and younger adults often experience similar effects on their perception of pain from treatment with physical modalities. Therefore, use of these modalities for chronic pain in older adults is appropriate, but special precautions need to be taken. Practitioners applying physical modalities need formal training that includes the risks and precautions for these modalities. If practitioners lack formal training in the use of physical modalities, or if modality use is not within their scope of practice, it is important to consult with and refer patients to members of the team who have this specialized training. Use of a multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain management is of value for all adults and older individuals in particular [79-81]. Historically, physical therapists have been trained to evaluate and treat patients with the range of physical modalities discussed in this article. Although members of the nursing staff traditionally have used some of these modalities (e.g. some forms of heat or cold and massage), increasing numbers of nurses now are being trained to apply more specialized procedures (e.g., TENS). Healthcare professionals must be knowledgeable about the strength of evidence underlying the use of physical modalities for the management of chronic pain. Based on the limited research evidence available (especially related to assistive devices, orthotics, and thermal modalities), it often is difficult to accept or exclude select modalities as having a potential role in chronic pain management for adults and older individuals. Improved research methodologies are needed to address physical modality effectiveness better.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14567204/"}

The purposes of this study were to document common experiences in the practice of acute care physical therapy and to identify differences in the perceptions of physical therapists with varying levels of experience and in various sizes of acute care facilities. A survey questionnaire was mailed to 500 randomly selected physical therapists employed in acute care facilities. The therapists answered questions regarding the frequency of various physical therapy evaluation and treatment practices, problems encountered in delivering physical therapy services, coordination of the discharge planning process, and perceptions of staffing trends in the acute care setting. The responses of 188 physical therapists who completed the survey were compared by their experience levels and the size of the institutions in which they practiced. Subjects reported that patient factors, such as medical complications and cooperation; organizational factors, such as staffing shortages and large caseloads; and health care system constraints, such as difficulty changing orders and limited time in which to work with the patient interfered with patients reaching physical therapy goals.

{"id": "30423137", "title": "The Effectiveness of an Upper Extremity Neuromuscular Training Program on the Shoulder Function of Military Members With a Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.", "text": "Shoulder pain, a leading reason to consult a physician or physiotherapist, continues to be a challenge to rehabilitate, particularly with a military population. A rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, the most important source of shoulder pain, is one of the leading reasons for sick leave or a discharge from active military service. Research encourages the use of exercise prescription for the management of a RC tendinopathy, however the ideal method of delivery (group setting versus one-on-one) remains uncertain. The purpose of this single-blind (evaluator) pilot randomized clinical trial was to compare two 6-week rehabilitation programs, a newly developed group-supervised neuromuscular training program and usual one-on-one physiotherapy care, on the pain and symptoms of Canadian soldiers affected by a RC tendinopathy. Thirty-one soldiers with the Canadian Armed Forces were randomly assigned to (1) a group-supervised neuromuscular training program (UPEx-NTP) or; (2) one-on-one usual physiotherapy care (UPC). The primary outcome was the Disability of Arm, Hand and Shoulder (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) Index, pain levels at rest, and maximum isometric voluntary contractions (MIVC) of the abductors and external (lateral) rotators of the affected shoulder. Both were assessed at baseline (T0), 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) weeks. Analysis included two-way repeated measures of variance for intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. Eighty military members with a RC tendinopathy were contacted, resulting in 31 participants who were randomized for their active intervention, in the UPEx-NTP or UPC, respectively. No significant group (p ≥ 0.16) or group × time interactions (p ≥ 0.11) were found for either ITT or per-protocol analyses. A statistically significant time effect (p < 0.001) was established for the DASH and WORC, showing that both groups improved over time. Our preliminary data demonstrates that both rehabilitation approaches, grounded in active exercises, were not statistically different from each other, and derived similar benefits over time for a military population. This suggests that a group intervention for a RC tendinopathy has potential to be just as effective as a one-on-one approach for a military population, an interesting avenue for an active working population. Larger sample sizes and further investigation are warranted regarding the cost and clinical resource benefits of a supervised group approach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30423137/"}

The efficacy of these intense regimens has led some to conclude that intense training regimens should be more widely applied clinically and has caused some physicians to attempt implementation of more intense training regimens with stroke patients. However, intense protocols may not be needed to produce positive motor changes in some patients and may not be plausible in some environments or with some patients. In this commentary, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of less intense, task-specific training regimens emphasizing the use of the more affected limb. We submit that intensity does not need to be altered to induce substantial clinical improvements, as some have suggested. Rather, the results of the studies suggest that the nature of stroke motor therapy itself can be altered to be more task-specific while remaining within the typical contact time parameters (i.e., 30-45 min/session), yet can be more efficacious than more traditional motor rehabilitative approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12960917/"}

Treatment therapies and exercises.", "text": "Physical rehabilitation (physiotherapy) involves restoring a patient's movement and function following an injury, illness or trauma. It can be used for acute and chronic conditions and, in some cases, the techniques are used as a preventive treatment. Some therapies can also provide pain relief, which can be especially helpful when analgesic drugs are contraindicated in a patient. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the application of physiotherapy to small animals, and while physical rehabilitation has traditionally been used more commonly for canine than feline patients, as cats can benefit just as much as dogs, this trend is changing. A multidisciplinary team is involved and identifying when a cat is painful and prioritizing therapies accordingly is crucial. Cats are not accustomed to regular handling or restraint and tend to become uninterested and frustrated quickly, which means they are often perceived as poor candidates for physiotherapy referral. As well as a cat's temperament, there are physical factors that may limit or exclude particular therapies; for instance, a cat's level of cardiovascular health. There can also be much variation with the success of different therapies - what works well in one individual might have no effect in another. This article, the second in a two-part series, discusses individual therapies and exercises for physical rehabilitation. This follows on from Part 1, which discusses the most common painful conditions in cats that can benefit from physical rehabilitation, as well as the importance of prioritizing the type of therapy depending on the individual patient.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40605842/"}

Sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent TKR surgery during the years 2007-2009. We used regression analysis to evaluate the effect of physician self-referral on the following outcomes: (1) time from discharge to first physical therapy visit; (2) episode length; (3) number of physical therapy visits per episode; (4) number of physical therapy service units per episode; and (5) number of physical therapy services per episode expressed in relative value units. TKR patients who underwent physical therapy treatment at a physician-owned clinic received on average twice as many physical therapy visits (8.3 more) than patients whose TKR surgery was performed by a orthopedic surgeon who did not self-refer physical therapy services (p < .001). Regression-adjusted results show that TKR patients treated at physician-owned clinics received almost nine fewer physical therapy service units during an episode compared with patients treated by nonself-referring providers (p < .001). In relative value units, this difference was 4 (p < .001). In contrast, episodes where the orthopedic surgeon owner does not profit from physical therapy services rendered to the patient look virtually identical to episodes where the TKR surgery was performed by a surgeon nonowner.

Thus, we have been able to fix the way of directing a first examination for the taking in charge in ergotherapy; examination that should point out the fields in which the patient can be mobilized (as well from the level where he is as from the investment one can expect in regard to the pleasure or the interest that he shows for a work rather than another). Besides, we tried to represent the channels of activities and their relations, starting from the most elementary one to reach the most complicated one, that is to say the ones that allow us to work on reality. It is in the network of these channels that the proposed activities should find their place in the ergotherapy workshop and their application should permit the readaptation to everyday actions in a progressive way.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/694471/"}

Our purpose was to test the null hypothesis that no significant difference in torque would be manifested between the rehabilitated postmeniscectomy knee and the normal knee. Mean torque developed by the rehabilitated postoperative knee was 10 to 12 percent less than the mean torque developed by the normal knee. We found a significant difference between means of torque of the normal knee and the rehabilitated knee for isometric flexion, rapid dynamic flexion, and rapid dynamic extension. Means of torque of knee extension for the three types of contraction for both knees of the subjects demonstrated similar patterns in which torque developed isometrically was greater than torque developed by slow dynamic tension, which in turn was greater than torque developed by rapid dynamic contraction. Means of torque of knee flexion for the three types of contraction for both knees of the subjects created patterns in which torque developed isometrically was essentially equal to torque developed by slow dynamic tension, and both these measurements exceeded torque developed by rapid dynamic contractions. Overall, the results suggest that physical therapists need to use rehabilitative techniques that promote muscular power and muscular endurance in addition to muscular strength and that more attention needs to be directed to the rehabilitation of knee flexors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/432280/"}

{"id": "9408934", "title": "A multidimensional scaling analysis of the techniques that physiotherapists use.", "text": "Following the essentially 'hands-on' origin of the physiotherapy profession a century ago, the range of techniques available to practitioners has expanded considerably. While this expansion of techniques has been of research interest, the main focus has been upon individual techniques, thus neglecting the fundamental question of the use of techniques in combination. In addition, researchers have tended to treat the profession as homogeneous, thus overlooking possible differences in technique usage. The present study addressed these questions. It postulated that ordered combinations of techniques usage would be employed, and that a typology would exist that differentiates the profession according to patterns of use. The study comprised a questionnaire survey of 230 clinical physiotherapists in England. This sought information on the range and frequency of techniques used over the previous six months. Descriptive analysis indicated a high frequency of use of several techniques, notably exercise therapy, passive mobilisation techniques and ultrasound. A feature of the analysis was the use of two multivariate procedures, multidimensional scalogram analysis (MSA) and smallest space analysis (SSA). The SSAs revealed a clear structure concerning combinations of techniques used, and the MSAs provided a coherent typology based upon this usage. One feature of the techniques in combination that emerged was the frequent use of passive mobilising techniques, which was associated with equally frequent use of electrotherapy techniques. In contrast, respondents who employed neurological or respiratory techniques made little use of electrotherapy. Regarding the typology, differentiation of the profession according to use of particular combinations of techniques indicated probable specialisms. The specialist areas identified were neurological physiotherapy, respiratory physiotherapy and musculo-skeletal physiotherapy. The results reinforce the need for both future research and physiotherapy education to address the issue of techniques in combination. Finally, and on the basis of the analyses, elements of a theoretical model are advanced that may provide directions for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9408934/"}

To investigate physiotherapists' self-reported use of outcome measures as recommended in the Dutch Clinical Practice Guideline on Physiotherapy Management of Patients with Stroke (CPGPS) and to assess perceived barriers to and facilitators for the use of outcome measures in everyday practice. A 41-item survey, including the barriers and facilitators questionnaire (BFQ), was sent by post to 400 physiotherapists in each of the following settings in the Netherlands: acute care hospitals (ACH; n = 100), rehabilitation centres (RC; n = 100), nursing homes (NH; n = 100) and private physiotherapy practices (PPP; n = 100). One hundred and eighty-nine physiotherapists returned the survey (47%; ACH, n = 57; RC, n = 67; NH, n = 26 and PPP, n = 39) and the surveys of 167 physiotherapists involved in stroke settings were analysed. These physiotherapists reported regularly using three (median; range 0-7) of the seven recommended outcome measures, with those working in RC or ACH reporting a significantly higher use than their colleagues in PPP (4 vs. 0 and 3 vs. 0; p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). The BFQ revealed that there were setting-specific facilitators, such as 'a positive attitude towards outcome measures' (as mentioned by 93% of the physiotherapists) and 'acquaintance with outcome measures' (90%), and barriers such as 'changing routines' (32%), 'time investment' (29%) and 'financial compensation' (21%).

The project is the result of collaborative research between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany (PTB, DE), the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL, UK) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, Prevention and Health (TNO-PG, NL). The work has been undertaken under the 4th Framework Programme of the European Community (EC). Primary standard designs of radiation force balances based on both absorbing and reflecting targets have been constructed. To avoid heating effects, the measurements should be done relatively quickly (10 to 20 s). The methods have been validated using ultrasound (US) transducers that demonstrated an adequate short and long-term stability; a method to detect cavitation based on monitoring the acoustic signals produced by bubble oscillation and collapse has been confirmed. It has been shown that only the detection of the subharmonic can be used in practice as cavitation detector. Different procedures for obtaining degassed water have been investigated. A method showing significant promise to be used in a clinical or manufacturer's environment involves the addition of sodium sulphite (Na2SO3). During the validation process, commercially available radiation force balances and ultrasonic physiotherapy devices have also been evaluated. Limitations of current measurement methods and practices, including power measurements made on transducers exhibiting a diverging beam, have been identified. It has been shown that a reflecting target is not appropriate to measure powers of transducers with a ka-value < 30. Based on beam shape and target distance, it has been shown also that proper power measurements using a 45 degrees convex-conical reflecting target can never be performed for transducers with a ka-value < 17.4.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11369129/"}

Proper protection from trauma and overuse of the involved joints, and appropriate nutrition can afford optimal improvement in health status and general resistance. Proper orientation of the patient regarding the nature of his disease and treatment program usually is required to obtain his full cooperation. A kind, encouraging, and understanding approach is most helpful in the elderly patient. Physical rehabilitation can help to relieve pain, decrease edema and deformities, improve muscle weakness and incoordination, and increase stamina. Difficulties with gait, transfers, and self-care can be solved or improved. Physical medicine and rehabilitation measures are important components of the challenging treatment of patients of all age groups who are afflicted with severe arthritis. It is most important to tailor these components of the treatment program to the problem presented by geriatric arthritic patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/833412/"}

There is evidence of muscle dysfunction related to the control of the movement system. There is a clear link between reduced proprioceptive input, altered slow motor unit recruitment and the development of chronic pain states. Dysfunction in the global and local muscle systems is presented to support the development of a system of classification of muscle function and development of dysfunction related to musculoskeletal pain. The global muscles control range of movement and alignment, and evidence of dysfunction is presented in terms of imbalance in recruitment and length between the global stability muscles and the global mobility muscles. Direction related restriction and compensation to maintain function is identified and related to pathology. The local stability muscles demonstrate evidence of failure of adequate segmental control in terms of allowing excessive uncontrolled translation or specific loss of cross-sectional area at the site of pathology. Motor recruitment deficits present as altered timing and patterns of recruitment. The evidence of local and global dysfunction allows the development of an integrated model of movement dysfunction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11243905/"}

In order to provide physiotherapy appropriate to the needs of individuals with MS, it is necessary to assess and evaluate the nature and degree of motor and functional deficits. The aim of this research was to develop a physiotherapy assessment which would consistently and objectively evaluate motor function in people with MS. The Motor Club Assessment (MCA), originally developed for use in stroke patients, was identified as exhibiting several features which were consonant with the required criteria. It was therefore modified for use in MS. The Amended MCA (AMCA) was tested for inter-rater agreement, which was found to be good for the lower limb motor section (weighted kappa = 0.80), the upper limb motor section (weighted kappa = 0.90), and the functional activities section (weighted kappa = 0.92). The internal consistency was high for the lower limb section (alpha = 0.97) and the functional activities section (alpha = 0.92), but could not be determined for the upper limb section due to a clear ceiling effect.

The primary objective of our study was to investigate the authority of PTs to order MSK imaging. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the authority for PTs to order MSK imaging. 111 WCPT member nations were surveyed over a 2-month period on the authority of PTs ordering MSK imaging within their nation. A secondary analysis utilizing a step-wise binary regression compared member nation demographic statistics to MSK imaging authority. 81 member nations responded to the survey. 31 (38.3%) of member nations reported having some level of PT MSK imaging authority while 50 (61.7%) did not. Member nations with lower per capita healthcare costs were significantly more likely to allow PTs to order MSK imaging (p = 0.02). Those with direct access authority were 7.4 times more likely to authorize PTs to order MSK imaging (p < 0.01). Entry-level clinical degree and years of entry-level collegiate credit were not associated with imaging authority. This is the first study to report MSK imaging policy within the WCPT member nations. While many nations within the WCPT allow PTs to order MSK imaging, the majority of nations still restrict PTs from such practice. Lower per capita healthcare costs and direct access authority were significant predictors of MSK imaging authority, however, causation cannot be established within the confines of this study.

The patient was an adolescent with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy classified as GMFCS level III who was treated during a summer session in a school-based setting. The patient participated in 11 training sessions, 2 of which included other players. Sessions were between 60 and 90 minutes in duration. Training was performed using the Wii sports games software, including boxing, tennis, bowling, and golf. He trained in both standing and sitting positions. Three main outcome measures were used: (1) visual-perceptual processing, using a motor-free perceptual test (Test of Visual Perceptual Skills, third edition); (2) postural control, using weight distribution and sway measures; and (3) functional mobility, using gait distance. Improvements in visual-perceptual processing, postural control, and functional mobility were measured after training. The feasibility of using the system in the school-based setting during the summer session was supported. For this patient whose rehabilitation was augmented with the Wii, there were positive outcomes at the impairment and functional levels. Multiple hypotheses were proposed for the findings that may be the springboard for additional research.

In those two countries, World War I had been a period of organization and recognition which had brought out the practice as a complement of military surgery. In Quebec, the medical issues at stake, which were important at first, were progressively reduced because of private activity exploiting physiotherapists. The profession's protection system showed its efficiency by having doctors' lack of competence in physiotherapy acknowledged. Such a situation led on the free access to physiotherapy for patients. But the sharing of medical acts with other professions remained a serious handicap. In France, the medical issues at stake remain significant. Physicians have always kept physiotherapists and physiotherapy under control through medical prescription, physiotherapists being perceived as considerably less threatening towards the autonomy of the profession.

Most of the UERE had two major problems: The base of the equipment was unstable, and the equipment was uninteresting to use. The therapists reported that three major needs for design improvement in the UERE were adjustability of functions, exchangeability of components and recording of movement data. Some therapists had suggestions for designing new types of UERE, such as manual dexterity training equipment, activities of daily living oriented equipment, sensory re-education equipment, arm supination and pronation training equipment, and wrist extension training equipment. These findings reveal the genuine user needs of upper extremity devices and provide useful applications to the development and re-design of these devices.

However, the IDEA does not provide specific guidance for the provision of school-based PT, resulting in variations in practice across the United States. The authors examined 22 state and local education agency guidelines available online to find commonalities related to the determination of a student's need for PT. Seven commonalities found: educational benefit, team decision, need for PT expertise, establishment of Individualized Education Program (IEP) goal before determining need for PT, distinction between medical and educational PT, the student's disability adversely affects education, and the student's potential for improvement. These commonalities are discussed in relation to current PT and special education literature.

Educators responsible for teaching ethics in the 28 Canadian PT and OT programs (n = 55) completed an online survey. The quantity of ethics teaching is highly variable, ranging from 5 to 65 h. Diverse obstacles to ethics teaching were reported, relating to the organization and structure of academic programs, student issues and the topic of ethics itself. Specific challenges included time constraints, large class sizes, a lack of pedagogical tools adapted to teaching this complex subject, a perceived lack of student interest for the subject and a preference for topics related to clinical skills. Of note, 65% of ethics educators who participated in the survey did not have any specialized training in ethics. Significant cross-program variation in the number of hours dedicated to ethics and the diversity of pedagogical methods used suggests that there is little consensus about how best to teach ethics. Further research on ethics pedagogy in PT and OT programs (i.e. teaching and evaluation approaches and effectiveness of current ethics teaching) would support the implementation of more evidence-based ethics education. Implications for Rehabilitation Ethics educators in Canadian PT and OT programs are experimenting with diverse educational approaches to teach ethical reasoning and decision-making to students, including lectures, problem-based learning, directed readings, videos, conceptual maps and clinical elective debriefing, but no particular method has been shown to be more effective for developing ethical decision-making/reasoning. Thus, research on the effectiveness of current methods is needed to support ethics educators and programs to implement evidence-based ethics education training. In our survey, 65% of ethics educators did not have any specialized training in ethics. Ensuring that educators are well equipped to support the development of necessary theoretical and applied competencies can be promoted by initiatives including the creation of tailored ethics teaching and evaluation tools, and by establishing communities of practice among ethics educators. This survey identified heterogeneity in ethics teaching content, format and duration, and location within the curriculum. In order to be able to assess more precisely the place accorded to ethics teaching in PT and OT programs, careful mapping of ethics content inside and across rehabilitation programs is needed - both in Canada and internationally. These initiatives would help advance understanding of ethics teaching practices in rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25704144/"}

High-quality controlled trials should align to this truth, and method quality markers should predict truth status. We sought to determine in what way controlled trial quality relates to scientific truth, and to determine predictive utility of trial quality and bibliographic markers. A sample of reviews in rehabilitation medicine was examined. Two scientific truth dimensions were established based on review outcomes. Quality and bibliographic markers were extracted from associated trials for use in a regression analysis of their predictive utility for trial truth status. Probability analysis was undertaken to examine judgments of future trial truth status. Of the 93 trials included in contemporaneous reviews, overall, n = 45 (48%) were true. Randomization was found more in true trials than false trials in one truth dimension (P = 0.03). Intention-to-treat analysis was close to significant in one truth dimension (P = 0.058), being more commonly used in false trials. There were no other significant differences in quality or bibliographic variables between true and false trials. Regression analysis revealed no significant predictors of trial truth status. Probability analysis reported that the reasonable chance of future trials being true was between 2 and 5%, based on a uniform prior.

{"id": "1804076", "title": "Patterns of use of chest physiotherapy in a teaching hospital.", "text": "Studies of chest physiotherapy in medical patients have consistently shown benefit only in patients who produce large amounts of sputum. Among surgical patients systematically repeated maximal inspiration is the only procedure that clearly reduces the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications. Rationalization of the use of physiotherapy requires data on the pattern of its use. To obtain such data an audit was conducted on the use of physiotherapy in patients discharged from Royal Newcastle Hospital in October 1989. It was suspected that respiratory physicians would account for the bulk of chest physiotherapy. All patients admitted under respiratory physicians and random samples of patients admitted under other physicians and under surgical specialists were surveyed. Chest physiotherapy was ordered in 13/44 (30%) patients cared for by respiratory physicians, 5/45 (11%) other medical patients and 11/48 (23%) surgical patients (P = 0.049). Chest physiotherapy was ordered in 28 of 29 instances for conditions in which it is of no proven benefit. From the total numbers of medical and surgical patients it was estimated that 71% of chest physiotherapy referrals in October 1989 were for non-medical patients. About half of all referrals were initiated by junior medical staff. Much of the chest physiotherapy performed in the hospital was unlikely to have been of major clinical value and patients with respiratory illnesses were minor consumers of chest physiotherapy. Attempts to reduce wasteful overuse of chest physiotherapy may be most effective if directed at physiotherapists. If medical staff are targeted it would be essential to reach those attached to surgical units.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1804076/"}

Whilst KT training programmes have been reported to significantly improve evidence uptake by physiotherapists, it is unclear which aspects of training optimally assist KT into physiotherapy practice. The purpose of the review was to establish the body of evidence regarding KT training programmes to improve physiotherapists' use of evidence-based practice (EBP) and clinical practice guidelines (CPG). A systematic scoping review was undertaken in line with the adapted Arksey and O'Malley framework. Nine electronic databases (CINAHL, BIOMED CENTRAL, Cochrane, Web of Science, PROQUEST, PUBMED, OTseeker, Scopus, ERIC) were searched. Targeted keywords identified primary research articles of any hierarchy, that described the nature and impact of KT training programmes for physiotherapists. Where systematic reviews were identified, the component primary studies were considered individually for relevance. Critical appraisal was not undertaken due to the nature of a scoping review, and data was reported descriptively. Ten systematic reviews were identified (yielding four relevant primary studies). Five additional primary studies were identified (two randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised controlled trials and one pre-post study) which were not included in the original systematic reviews. This provided nine eligible primary research studies for review. The KT strategies were all multi-faceted. Interactive sessions, didactic sessions, printed material and discussion and feedback were consistently associated with effective outcomes. When KT strategies addressed local barriers to EBP utilisation, there were better success rates for EBP and CPG uptake, irrespective of the outcome measures used. There were no consistent ways of measuring outcome. Multi-faceted KT strategies designed to address local barriers to knowledge translation were most effective in improving EBP/ CPG uptake among physiotherapists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334943/"}

For this purpose articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro, DARE and PiCarta and references presented in relevant publications were examined. Although, there is strong evidence that early augmented exercise therapy time (expressed as time dedicated to practice) may enhance functional recovery, there is a discrepancy between the evidence for the benefits of intensive practice, on the one hand, and, the implementation of intensive rehabilitation treatment programmes in the current healthcare system on the other. Further emphasis should be given on a better understanding of the time-dependency of prognostic factors that determine the effectiveness of intensive practice in patients with stroke. In addition, a better understanding is needed of the neurophysiological and biomechanical mechanisms that underlie compensation-related learning of functional tasks after stroke.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16777769/"}

A wide variety of interventions are used in the management of FM. There is, however, no clear consensus on the treatment of choice and FM remains relatively refractory to treatment. Therefore, prevention, causal therapy and rehabilitation are not possible. FM patients frequently use alternative therapies, indicating dissatisfaction or ineffectiveness of traditional medical therapy. Alternative therapies are generally perceived to be more \"natural\" and as a result, to have fewer adverse effects. Despite the positive results found, the number of publications related to the application of physical therapy modalities such as acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, laser, biofeedback, electrotherapy and magnetic field is still scant, especially concerning FM treatment. The demonstration of a long-term effective intervention for managing the symptoms associated with FM is needed. Multidisciplinary approaches to management include physical and medical therapeutic strategies. Treatment modalities should be individualised for patients based on target symptoms and impairment in functioning. Patience and positive attitude on part of the physician and active involvement of patients and their families in treatment are likely to enhance improvement. It can be concluded that there is a need for larger, more systematic and methodologically sound randomised controlled clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy modalities of managing FM. We will review some of the existing studies of physical therapy relevant in the treatment of FM and give some practical advice for their use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16454722/"}

It is now important to understand expert views and consensus across professions regarding prevention strategies and minimum requirements for reporting standards for future SAEs. A modified Delphi method was used, involving 28 international experts from various allied health professions, including chiropractic, physiotherapy, osteopathy, and medicolegal fields. The experts took part in three rounds of online surveys to reach a consensus on reporting, characteristics, risk factors, and prevention of SAEs associated with neck treatments. An agreement of >74 % was required before consensus was reached. Consensus was reached for more standardised reporting of SAEs across different types of treatments and professions. Addressing underlying health conditions and improving the recognition of potential risks, precautions, and contraindications during treatment were highlighted. Recommendations for strategies to improve safety, including early identification of risk factors and careful application of techniques, especially in vulnerable populations were also provided.

Angular velocity was systematically increased by raising the release position of a T-shaped pendulum. Angular velocities were examined by releasing the pendulum from four angles (0 degree-static, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 120 degrees). Twelve reference angles were estimated over 20 autodigitized frames for 10 trials at each release position. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to test the hypothesis that the error of angular estimates grows with increasing angular velocity. Mean errors of the reconstructed angles were consistently within +/- 1.0 degree, regardless of angular velocity. An ANOVA revealed a statistically significant angular velocity effect, characterized by release position. The 90-degree release position produced the greatest error, followed by the 120-, 45-, and 0-degree release positions. The error was not significantly different between the 120- and 45-degree release positions. Intraclass correlation coefficients greater than .90 were found for all frame-to-frame angular velocities, except for the 90-degree release position. The angle estimates consistently underestimated the reference angles, regardless of release position. The results suggest that clinically accurate angular estimates can be obtained across the range of angular velocities used in this study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413452/"}

At least some of these improvements can be attributed to better organization of services and improved rehabilitation. Many patients, however, remain severely disabled and we will need to develop new strategies in which the focus will be on reversing impairments rather than simply helping patients to adapt to unaltered impairments. For this to happen, neurological rehabilitation research will have to develop therapies that have a clearly defined rationale and are rooted in neurosciences, are clinically described, are addressed to a well-characterized target population and are evaluated using appropriate outcome measures. Few studies at present meet all these criteria. The recent revolution in our understanding of the nervous system as being soft-wired, of the potential for recovery through reorganization and of the central role of afferent information associated with normal activity is ground for optimism and indicates the direction in which future therapies should be sought. The paper considers some approaches to providing appropriate afferent information, including inputs such as that from electrotherapy, novel approaches to assisted activity and constraint-induced therapy. We are on the verge of a revolution in neurological rehabilitation. If we exploit the new understanding of the nervous system arising from basic neurosciences in developing and evaluating therapies we should be able to build on the achievements of the last few decades so that fewer of our patients have to carry the burden of severe disability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12109237/"}

Primary care physiotherapy provision appears to minimize the costs to patients of seeking care, and appears to generate a greater demand for service than other models. The extent to which physiotherapy provision in primary care can substitute for physiotherapy and other resources in the hospital sector is discussed, as is the extent to which patients may benefit from receiving physiotherapy in primary care.

Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched up to and including July 2023. We included trials and observational studies evaluating the use of consumer-grade wearables, in real patient cohorts, to aid physical therapy or rehabilitation. Only studies investigating rehabilitation of acute events with defined recovery affecting adult patients were included. Two independent reviewers used a standardised protocol to search, screen and extract data from the included studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Methods Risk of Bias in Randomised Trials V.2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tools for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, respectively. Eighteen studies encompassing 1754 patients met eligibility criteria, including six RCTs, six quasi-experimental studies and six observational studies. Eight studies used wearables in Orthopaedics, seven in Stroke Medicine, two in Oncology and one in General Surgery. All six RCTs demonstrated that wearable-driven feedback increases physical activity. Step count was the most common measure of physical activity. Two RCTs in orthopaedics demonstrated non-inferiority of wearable self-directed rehabilitation compared with traditional physiotherapy, highlighting the potential of wearables as alternatives to traditional physiotherapy. All 12 non-randomised studies demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of wearable-driven self-directed rehabilitation. This review demonstrates that consumer-grade wearables can be used as adjuncts to traditional physiotherapy, and potentially as alternatives for self-directed rehabilitation of non-chronic conditions.

Assessment of the various components of CP shows that percussion, vibratory shaking, and breathing exercises have little to offer. Although instructed cough, the back up mucus clearance mechanism, is effective in clearing secretions its effect is less than that achieved with the forced expiration technique (FET). Postural drainage (PD) is on the whole successful in helping to drain secretions in the lungs. The administration of a beta 2-agonist via a nebulizer prior to CP in addition to promoting bronchodilation may also help to alter the physical properties of secretions, rendering them more amenable for clearance by FET/cough. Technology regarding high-frequency oscillations (HFO) has yet to be improved and its efficacy in clearing excess secretions proven prior to its inclusion in a CP treatment regimen. Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) may have a role to play in those patients where conventional CP is not possible. Data with positive expiratory pressure (PEP) are encouraging and direct evaluation is awaited regarding its effect on mucus clearance. With our present knowledge it seems reasonable to recommend that physiotherapists concentrate their CP treatment on the following: administration of a nebulized beta 2-agonist followed by PD and FET.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2117171/"}

Recent advances in technology have allowed for greater compliance with treatment and improved efficacy in pain control. This article was proposed to fill the gap in the literature addressing this specific patient population and to facilitate further research. Even though there is a lack of consensus among societies and experts on exact parameters of physical therapy (PT) considerations and postoperative limitations in patients with SCS, we propose rehabilitative care for this population should be standardized. As the number of patients with SCS implants grow, it is vital to understand how to appropriately approach patients with implantable devices when additional treatments such as PT are prescribed. A literature search was performed on the use of PT following SCS implantation. Presently, there is no literature to date which addresses the use of PT in this patient population. The lack of data is the largest hurdle in the creation of formal SCS therapy guidelines. The authors therefore proposed recommendations for rehabilitation based upon a detailed understanding of SCS hardware alongside well-studied physiotherapy concepts. Considerations when initiating PT in the SCS patient population should include: 1) biomechanics and quality of SCS output; 2) therapeutic exercise and spinal manipulation in association with risk for lead migration and fracture; 3) the application of therapeutic modalities and risk for injury to the patient and/or damage to the SCS componentry; and 4) integration of a biopsychosocial, person-centered approach. PT treatment protocol in patients with a recently implanted SCS device should be person-centered addressing individual needs, values, and goals. Further research is needed to fully appreciate the impact of an interprofessional approach to management of SCS patients, particularly following stimulator implantation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33819381/"}

The method consists of exposing an acoustic absorber tile, part of which contains a thermochromic pigment, to the ultrasonic beam, thereby forming an image of the intensity profile of the transducer. Images acquired using thermochromic materials were postprocessed in order to estimate effective radiating area (ERA) and beam nonuniformity ratio (BNR) for ultrasound transducers operating within the frequency range from 1.0 to 3.3 MHz, and nominal applied intensities in the range of 1-2W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Results of our measurements have shown that thermocromic tile can be used for quality control of ultrasound transducers in the hospital environment. Experimental results show that proposed method can be used to distinguish highly non - uniform ultrasound beams with high value of BNR. Influence of exposure duration on obtained ERA and BNR values was also analysed. Our results show that values for ERA increase with insonation time, while BNR values decrease. In order to compare our results with theory we have estimated temperature rise in thermochromic material experimentally and compare it with theoretical prediction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31398497/"}

The qualitative data collection methods of interview, nonparticipant observation, and document analysis were used in constructing case studies of five physical therapy education program accreditation visits. Results of this research indicated that on-site evaluators represent an elite community within the field and share similar values about the profession. These shared values about the professionalization of physical therapy formed the basis for evaluators' interpretation of accreditation standards. Evaluators' emphasis on the professional values that focus on defining and validating the body of knowledge in physical therapy and faculty endorsement of the norms of the academic work place have implications for the continued professionalization of physical therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3174834/"}

Glossopharyngeal breathing is being considered again and is often a useful technique for increasing the effectiveness of cough in patients with tetraplegia or neuromuscular disorders. The evidence in support of these techniques is variable, and the literature is confusing and conflicting. There may or may not be significant differences among the techniques in the short or long term.

Most recent studies have focused on in-patient rehabilitation and have demonstrated benefits across disability, handicap, and quality of life in patients with mild to severe disability. Such benefits persist following discharge into the community. Studies evaluating service delivery and components of the rehabilitation package are in progress, but few investigators have taken on the intrinsic elements or 'black box' of rehabilitation.

However, incontinence management is not limited to the PT. Providing the best care to incontinent patients requires open communication among professions, disciplines, and care settings where incontinence specialists may be found. To help illustrate this point, a professional opinion survey was sent to leading PTs and RNs who conservatively treat and manage incontinence. Respondents were asked about the following: entry point, preparation, and practice setting; general practice description; assessment and treatment; individual practice innovations; what is unique to physical therapy and nursing; and interaction between the professions. Twenty-six (26) responses were received. While responses varied among PTs and RNs, both professions agreed that musculoskeletal assessment and treatment were unique contributions of physical therapy while medical/surgical expertise and pharmacologic issues were unique contributions of nursing to the field of incontinence.

Common conditions benefiting from physiotherapy.", "text": "Physical rehabilitation (physiotherapy) involves restoring a patient's movement and function following an injury, illness or trauma. It can be used for acute and chronic conditions and, in some cases, the techniques are used as a preventive treatment. Some therapies can also provide pain relief, which can be especially helpful when analgesic drugs are contraindicated in a patient. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the application of physiotherapy to small animals, and while physical rehabilitation has traditionally been used more commonly for canine than feline patients, as cats can benefit just as much as dogs, this trend is changing. A multidisciplinary team is involved and identifying when a cat is painful and prioritizing therapies accordingly is crucial. Cats are typically not accustomed to regular handling or restraint and tend to become uninterested and frustrated quickly, which means they are often perceived as poor candidates for physiotherapy referral. As well as a cat's temperament, there are physical factors that may limit or exclude particular therapies; for instance, a cat's level of cardiovascular health. There can also be much variation with the success of different therapies - what works well in one individual might have no effect in another. This article, the first in a two-part series, discusses the most common painful conditions in cats that can benefit from physical rehabilitation, as well as the importance of prioritizing the type of therapy depending on the individual patient.

Statistical comparison by physician joint venture ownership status of freestanding physical therapy and comprehensive rehabilitation facilities providing physical therapy treatments in Florida. A total of 118 outpatient physical therapy facilities and 63 outpatient comprehensive rehabilitation facilities providing services in Florida during 1989. The data from the facilities were collected under a legislative mandate. Visits per patient, average revenue per patient, percent operating income, percent markup, profits per patient, licensed therapist time per visit, and licensed and nonlicensed medical worker time per visit. Visits per patient were 39% to 45% higher in joint venture facilities. Both gross and net revenue per patient were 30% to 40% higher in facilities owned by referring physicians. Percent operating income and percent markup were significantly higher in joint venture physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities. Licensed physical therapists and licensed therapist assistants employed in non-joint venture facilities spend about 60% more time per visit treating physical therapy patients than licensed therapists and licensed therapist assistants working in joint venture facilities. Joint ventures also generate more of their revenues from patients with well-paying insurance. Our results indicate that utilization, charges per patient, and profits are higher when physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities are owned by referring physicians. With respect to service characteristics, joint venture firms employ proportionately fewer licensed therapists and licensed therapist assistants to perform physical therapy, so that licensed professionals employed in joint venture businesses spend significantly less time per visit treating patients. These results should be of interest to the medical profession, third-party payers, and policymakers, all of whom are concerned about the consequences of physician self-referral arrangements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1404742/"}

Early work on treatment of patients with cerebral palsy and polio led to improvements in treatment approaches used to facilitate motor skill and functional motor ability in patients with upper motor neuron disorders. From the 1950s to the present, therapists have refined their treatment techniques as knowledge from neuroscience has become available.

At present, the main lines along which physiotherapy develops include acquisition of new information necessary to formulate the theoretical basis for instrumental physiotherapy, comprehensive estimation of the influence of the new and traditional preformed physical factors on the general health-maintaining mechanisms (adaptation, compensation), investigations into pathogenesis of various diseases, development of effective therapeutic and health-promoting modalities with the elaboration of indications and contraindications for their prescription, elucidation of the possibility and expediency of joint or combined application of various physical factors. The great importance is attached under present-day conditions to the development of personalized approaches to the choice of physiotherapeutic modality for the treatment of concrete patients on an individual basis taking into consideration the known predictors of efficiency of a given method. One of the most rapidly developing directions is regenerative physiotherapy, i.e., a multidisciplinary branch of biomedicine that studies the mechanisms of action and the effectiveness of natural preformed physical factors for the restoration of damaged tissues and disturbed functions of the organs. Of special value are investigations devoted to the elucidation of the possibilities for the combined application of cellular technologies and physiotherapeutic techniques. However, very much remains to be done for the creation of the scientific basis of biologically controlled (feedback-regulated) physiotherapy.

Most therapy concepts primarily focus on muscle strengthening, without taking into consideration that it is crucial to redress muscular imbalances by stretching contracted muscle groups as well. Based on this experience, the effectiveness of several specifically modified exercises was tested, derived from the usual range of physiotherapy activities in strengthening very commonly weakened muscle groups, i.e. the abdominal, gluteal, sacrospinalis and shoulder-blade affixing musculature. To increase exercise effectiveness, training machines were used in addition. Stretching exercises were carried out initially, in terms of passive stretching with isometric pre-tension. The following muscle groups were stretched: rectus femoris m., iliopsoas m., pectoralis m., and lumbar sacrospinalis m. Altogether, 64 patients between age 16 and 27 were examined following training therapy, 58 patients presented pure postural disorders, 6 had slight cerebral movement disorders. Two almost equal study groups were formed, one (31 patients) receiving only gymnastic exercises, the other (33 patients) using training machines. The muscular situation was tested after 6 months by means of Janda's semiquantitative muscle-testing. For further objective assessment of therapy outcome, Neugebauer's 'back-index' was determined.

The results concerning the general measurement of the satisfaction with the rehabilitation measure showed a high level and a high acceptance in all forms of medical care at the end of and after the measure. The result relating to the selection of the correct hospital for the specific troubles of the patient was positive as well. This can also be stated for the patients' estimation of the contacts between the doctors and the physiotherapists. At the end of measure, all the patients in every form of care viewed these contacts as being helpful. The outpatient offers were viewed a bit better by the patients concerning the contacts to doctors and physiotherapists.

Strengthening, electrical stimulation, the use of orthoses, and seating show positive effects in studies of small numbers of subjects. For severely involved children, ease of care and comfort are important goals, as well as prevention of deformity, which is important for all children. To the extent possible, therapy should prepare a child for independent adult life. In early intervention through school age, therapy focuses on promoting communication, self-care, and mobility.

Modern concepts of motor learning favour a task-specific repetitive approach, i.e. \"whoever wants to learn to walk again must walk.\" However, the physical demands this places on the therapist, is a limiting factor in the clinical routine setting. This article describes a robotic walking simulator for gait training that enables wheelchair-bound subjects to freely carry out repetitive practicing of an individually adapted gait pattern under simulation of the manual guidance of an experienced therapist. The technical principle applied makes use of programmable footplates with permanent foot/machine contact in combination with compliance control. The solution chosen comprises a planar parallel-serial hybrid kinematic system with three degrees of freedom that moves the feet in the sagittal plane. Gait analysis while floor walking and stair climbing, clinical practicability and safety aspects were the basis for the design. A variable compliance control enables man-machine interaction, ranging from purely position controlled movement to full compliance during swing phase above a virtual ground profile. In full compliance mode the robotic walking simulator behaves like a haptic device. The concept presented offers new prospects for individualized gait rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14606269/"}

As the abnormality is strictly on one side of the body in most people, the circuitry is minimised, as gait can be analysed by only comparing muscle activity in the affected gluteus medius muscle with that in the unaffected gluteus medius muscle, through the EMG. Two foot contact switches are used to help assess timing of the step cycle. If gait is different on the two sides of the body, an audio cue directs the patient to correct the abnormality by increasing activity on the affected side. The device is tested on five patients. Trendelenburg gait is reduced by an average of 29 degrees through the use of the device. The average stride length at the beginning of the study is 0.32 +/- 0.3 m. By the end of the study, the stride length is increased to 0.45 +/- 0.2 m for the entire group of five subjects.

{"id": "14579018", "title": "[Physical therapy to treat spinal stenosis].", "text": "Spinal stenosis mainly is a disease of the elderly. In most cases the lumbar spine is affected. The assessment is based on the typical constellation of symptoms (neurogenic claudication, subjective weakness) and physical findings (abnormal reflex status, loss of strength, sensory deficits, impairment in balance and coordination). The diagnosis is further supported by the radiologic proof of a stenosis of the spinal canal, the lateral recess, and the intervertebral foramina. The main targets of physical and rehabilitative medicine are the relief of pain and an improvement in the activities of daily living, which are especially impaired by reduced walking distance and difficulties in climbing stairs. These can be achieved by multimodal, conservative management: physiotherapy, occupational therapy, treatment of myofascial disorders, and oral medication/local injections. Physiotherapy aims at a stabilization of the lumbar spine in a flexed posture rather than in lumbar lordosis and at an increase of overall physical fitness. Oral analgetic and/or anti-inflammatory medical management is based on the three-step scheme of the World Health Organization, which also can be applied for low back pain.

In the treatment of patients with chronic pain, the aim of therapy as well as the technique of the traditionally employed psychotherapeutic procedures need to be modified. What is of immediate importance is to promote an active pattern of coping with pain and discourage pain-related inactivity and reduce feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. To achieve this, it is necessary to combine various psychological treatment modalities (relaxation techniques and behavioural or psychodynamic therapy) with exercise programs as in physiotherapy or sports medicine. In the choice of the appropriate psychotherapeutic modalities, it is important to take into consideration the extent of chronicity of pain, the patient's subjective understanding of the illness, a possible wish of the patient for early retirement, previous experience with chronic pain and the extent to which the patient has been psychologically traumatised (especially in his childhood and youth). Relatives should be integrated in the planning and possibly also in carrying out of the treatment. Symptom-specific group therapy might motivate patients to undergo treatment and to change their habitual ways of life.

The surgeon is placed in a dilemma: on the one hand, if repair is achieved and the finger is kept immobile during the healing phase, dense adhesions may bind the tendons within the sheath and limit motion. On the other hand, uncontrolled early flexion may disrupt the tendon repair. Early 'controlled motion' increases tensile strength, reduces the formation of adhesions and improves clinical results. To investigate the relationship between the patient's compliance concerning the post-operative motion regimen and the final range of motion, a device has been developed which records when and how often the patient exercises. The device is attached to a modified Kleinert splint. This configuration enables comparison of the outcome of the rehabilitation of patients who exercise according to the rehabilitation programme with patients who exercise less often.

Secondly, parents receive conflicting messages from the physiotherapy consultation, but perceive the key message to be to prioritize adherence to physiotherapy. The final theme was that parents' expectations of the physiotherapy interaction were often not met, in particular a lack of practical physiotherapy education and training was reported. Parents of infants with CF seek an optimistic, practical and hands on approach during physiotherapy consultations.

Thirty-six undergraduate physical therapist students were randomly assigned to control (no feedback), concurrent feedback, and terminal feedback groups. The JTS was designed to simulate tissue resistance based on load-displacement relationships of glenohumeral joint specimens. Subjects applied specific mobilization grades of force on the JTS while quantitative feedback was given to the feedback groups either during a trial (ie, concurrent feedback) or after a trial (ie, terminal feedback). The skill acquisition phase lasted a total of 40 minutes, and a total of 75 repetitions were performed for each grade of each joint model. Pretest and no-feedback retention tests were conducted. During acquisition and retention, both feedback groups performed more accurately than did the control group. No obviously superior performance was shown by the terminal feedback group compared with concurrent feedback group during retention testing. Subjects who trained with augmented feedback had less variability, and thus more consistency, than the control group subjects who received no feedback. Augmented feedback provides the student with a reference force and the status of his or her performance. The effectiveness of the JTS feedback compared with no feedback was clearly demonstrated.

They offered many treatment modalities based on evidence of low quality or without evidence from systematic reviews, e.g. traction and mobilisation, massage and stretching. Exercise was used in almost all treatment sessions in the management of knee OA. This practice is desirable since it is supported by high quality evidence. Physiotherapists also provide several other treatment modalities based on evidence of moderate or low quality, or no evidence from systematic reviews. Ways to promote high quality evidence into physiotherapy practice should be identified and evaluated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18611250/"}

Using this market research strategic recommendations for the future marketing of physiotherapy are made within the professional context. Marketing will be used to contribute to changing the public perception of physiotherapy. The market research involved a qualitative study of five focus groups of the general public and one focus group of physiotherapists. The responses from the focus groups were used to construct an appropriate questionnaire for the qualitative study. A random sample of 510 members of the general public were then surveyed. The market research results yielded the following key features: The best known conditions treated by physiotherapists are musculoskeletal. The least known are women and children. Client-centered care is sought. The importance of location gives potential for physiotherapists to capitalise on tailoring to clients in their area. Doctors are important for referral and communication about physiotherapy. Marketing should be used to inform doctors of what physiotherapy has to offer. A marketing orientation has begun within physiotherapy; however, it must 'fit' the culture initially to be successful. A marketing strategy should be developed on national, state and individual levels based on a strategic intent. At the state level, strategies must be responsive to area or regional needs. Marketing needs to target identified market segments such as workers compensation organisations. Individual physiotherapists must promote themselves within their region, particularly to doctors and clients with the use of relationship marketing. Informal presentations to community groups and school students about physiotherapy will increase their profile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10141086/"}

Key words were: chondrocyte, cartilage, osteoarthritis, mechanical stimulation, exercises, physical therapy, rehabilitation. Were reviewed: the mechanical biology of the chondrocytes and the cartilage, the mechanisms of transduction, the metabolic response of the chondrocytes to mechanical stresses; the effects of physical activity and immobilization on the cartilage in animal models, the main studies on the epidemiology of limbs osteoarthritis and clinical trials on rehabilitation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that some molecules are involved in the transduction of mechanical stress into intracellular biological event. Chondrocytes and cartilage are sensitive to mechanical stress and cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation can be modulated by mechanical events. Applications of cyclic loads usually lead to an enhanced matrix synthesis while static loads usually decrease matrix production. In animal models, intensive physical activity or immobilization lead to cartilage alteration mimicking osteoarthritis. In human, intensive and prolonged physical activities are probably associated with hip and knee osteoarthritis. However, there is evidence that exercise therapy and continuous passive motion have beneficial effects on patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis. Fundamental and clinical studies are still needed to determine if exercise programs could have an effect on chondromodulation. Continuous passive motion could help, in the future, to better understand the relationship between mechanical stimulation and cartilage homeostasis.

Research into optimal nonsurgical treatment approaches for LSS is lacking. The purpose of this qualitative study is to assess the opinions of participants in a randomized clinical trial of nonsurgical LSS treatments regarding the interventions they received, factors contributing to adherence to the interventions, and methods of outcomes assessment. This study used a qualitative focus group design conducted at an academic research center. Individuals participating in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) for non-surgical LSS treatment were invited to discuss their study treatments and general experiences with LSS. The three treatment arms in the study were medical care, community-based group exercise, and clinic-based manual therapy and individual exercise. Following coding of qualitative data, kappa statistic was used to calculate agreement between observers. Themes were identified and agreed upon by both coders. This study was funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Fifty individuals (28 women, mean age 73±7.7 years) participated in a focus group. Two focus groups based on modified grounded theory were held for participants of each of the three treatment arms, for a total of six focus groups. Discussion topics included perceived effectiveness of the assigned treatment, suggestions for improvement, barriers and facilitators to completing treatment, and opinions of research outcome measures. Several themes were evident across all treatment groups. First, patients prefer individualized treatment that is tailored to their specific impairments and functional limitations. They also want to learn self-management strategies to rely less upon formal health care providers. Participants consistently stated that exercise improved their pain levels and physical function. However, they noted that these effects are temporary, so commitment to exercising long-term is important. Common barriers to completing the assigned LSS treatment included transportation issues and other comorbid health conditions. All three treatment groups cited perceived treatment benefit as a strong facilitator to continuing treatment. In addition, the ability of the health care provider to relate to the patient and listen to the patient's concerns was a common facilitator. Within the community-based group exercise treatment arm, most individuals continued group exercise after study completion, and social support was often mentioned as a facilitator to continuing treatment. Medical care was most often associated with minimal to no effect of treatment. Many individuals with LSS report barriers to accessing non-surgical treatment, but may also be willing to commit to a long-term treatment strategy that includes exercise. Social support from others with LSS and from health care providers with good communication skills may facilitate compliance with treatment recommendations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28870836/"}

The Vodder technique differs in the use of adapted pressure and its application. The constant change in pressure optimizes results, moving fluid in the skin, increasing lymphomotoricity, and softening fibrosis, with the positive side effects of reducing pain and relaxing tense muscles. Another difference from other methods is the technique of stretching skin, not sliding it. Because of the fluid content in lymphedema, which is different from all other edemas, the combination of MLD with compression treatment is the only solution for this pathology. Depending of it severity, each case requires individualized treatment. Phase 1 (intensive treatment) consists of daily treatment with up to two sessions per day for up to 2 hours. This phase is combined with special, individual skin care and remedial exercise. In phase 2, the goal of treatment is to maintain the results achieved in phase 1. The frequency of treatment is changed, but there is still the need for permanent, continued therapy. In phase 1, an average reduction of more than 40% of edema volume is achieved. In phase 2, the results are maintained and, with repetitions of phase 1, further improvement is possible. Thus, long term results with permanent improvement are possible. Because of the complexity of the technique, no one can learn MLD in 1 week. Students require a great deal of correction, and the technique must be checked constantly. To become a certified Vodder therapy, a 4-week education program must be completed, and reviews must be attended every 2 years to maintain certification. The best education produces the best results for patients as long as patients are compliant. Therefore, the Vodder School also includes a patient education program as part of its curriculum.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9874409/"}

Its most widely used treatment, known as the Rest Cure, relied heavily on physical therapies, but little is known about the practitioners who administered the treatment. In this paper, I argue that the nurse-masseuses who delivered the massage and electricity so vital to the success of the Rest Cure, used the opportunity to develop approaches to treatment that would form the backbone of the physiotherapy profession in England after 1894. <b>Methods:</b> Extensive primary and secondary texts were drawn from a wide range of sources and critically reviewed. <b>Findings:</b> This study argues that the management of neurasthenic cases in the 1880s and 90s created the conditions necessary for the development of the profession's relationship with medicine and the establishment of new practice roles for women, and that these would play an important role in shaping the physiotherapy profession in Britain after 1894. Read through the critical sociological writings of Magali Sarfatti Larson and Anne Witz, I argue that the work of the nurse-masseuses can be seen as a complex gendered negotiation between the need to be deferential to the dominant male medical profession; distinct from emerging notions of the angelic, motherly nurse; obedient, technically competent and safe. The creation of a space in the clinic room for a third practitioner who could deliver a different form of care to the doctor or the nurse, established an approach to practice that physiotherapists would later adopt almost without amendment. <b>Discussion:</b> I argue that this approach owes much to the work done by nurse-massueses who established and tested its principles in treating cases of neurasthenia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33586618/"}

This is best accomplished by applying specific types of stress to the involved and associated structures at optimal intervals during the rehabilitation process. Load must be applied at adequate intensity and duration to successfully affect the viscous property of connective tissue. This is necessary to effect permanent elongation of the restricted tissues. Early controlled motion is vital to prevent the negative changes associated with immobilization and to maintain normal viscoelasticity and homeostasis of connective tissue.

However, the use of agents in chronic pain management programs is common. Within the broad use of physical agents, they are rarely the sole modality of treatment. A 1995 American Physical Therapy Association position statement asserts that \"Without documentation which justifies the necessity of the exclusive use of physical agents/modalities, the use of physical agents/modalities, in the absence of other skilled therapeutic or educational intervention, should not be considered physical therapy\". Physical agents may serve as useful adjunctive modalities of pain relief or to enhance the effectiveness of other elements in therapy geared toward resolution of movement impairments and restoration of physical function. Given that a conclusive aggregate of findings is unlikely to exist for all permutations of patient conditions, combined with interacting therapeutic modalities, an evidence-based approach to pain management is not always possible or beneficial to the patient. In the face of inconclusive evidence, a theory-based approach may help determine if the therapeutic effect ofa given physical agent has the possibility of being a useful clinical tool in the context of treating a particular patient's mechanism of pain generation. Until controlled efficacy findings are definitive, careful individual patient response monitoring of thoughtful theoretical application of adjunctive physical agents may be a prudent approach to the management of chronic pain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16616270/"}

Parallel-forms intratester reliability for ankle AROM measurements obtained by the universal goniometer (UG) and by visual estimation (VE) and intertester reliability for VE of ADF and APF were examined. Repeated measurements were obtained on 38 patients with orthopedic problems by 10 physical therapists in a clinical setting. For intratester reliability of measurements obtained with UG, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for all physical therapists were 0.64 to 0.92 (median, 0.825) for ADF and 0.47 to 0.96 (median, 0.865) for APF. Intertester reliability was quantified with use of ICC. ICCs for measurements obtained by UG were 0.28 for ADF and 0.25 for APF; ICC of VE for ADF was 0.34 and was 0.48 for APF. ICC for parallel-forms intratester reliability obtained with UG and VE ranged from 0 to 0.94 (median, 0.58) for ADF and 0 to 0.86 (median, 0.625) for APF. Thus, a physical therapist should use a goniometer when making repeated measurements of ankle joint AROM. Considerable inconsistency exists when two or more physical therapists make repeated goniometric and visual measurements of ankle motion on the same subject.

Furthermore, giving learners some control over the training regimen has been found to enhance learning, unlike prescriptive training protocols that dictate when feedback will be delivered, how often, and the order that tasks will be practiced. Finally, not only can practice in dyads (or larger groups) reduce the costs of training, but it can also result in more effective learning than individual practice sessions.

It focuses on the implications of telerehabilitation requirements for safe treatment. As the global share of disabled and elderly people increases, the demand for effective teleoperated physiotherapy solutions rises, necessitating precise control over robotic systems. The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach to assess delays in communication between a rehabilitation exoskeleton and the control system's based on the digital twin in VR (virtual reality) components at different stages. Moreover, additional delays coming from distant operations are assessed. Key findings reveal that the average latency for joint control on shorter distances remains below 300 ms-considered acceptable for comfortable manual teleoperation. The delays between setting the device's configuration and reaching it by a physical exoskeleton differ for particular joints and depend mainly on the torque-to-moment of inertia ratio. The total communication cycle should not exceed 400 ms, which can be further reduced by using a 6G network in the future or ADS (Automation Device Specification) communication protocol instead of the database. Ultimately, the study provides a foundation for developing algorithms that can mitigate delays and improve the efficacy of telehealth solutions with physically supportive devices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40643990/"}

The articles must have been published in the last 10 years, had a sample exclusively of women with primary dysmenorrhea, had a randomized controlled trial design, and used interventions that included some form of manual therapy and/or electrotherapy techniques. Two reviewers independently screened articles for eligibility and extracted data. Difference in mean differences and their 95% CIs were calculated as the between-group difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation. The I2 statistic was used to determine the degree of heterogeneity. Twelve selected studies evaluated interventions, with 5 evaluating electrotherapy techniques and 7 evaluating manual therapy techniques. All studies analyzed identified improvements in pain intensity and meta-analysis confirmed their strong effect. Manual therapy and electrotherapy are effective for the treatment of women with primary dysmenorrhea. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with thermotherapy and effleurage massage stands out for its effects on the intensity and duration of pain with the application of a few sessions and their long-term effects. Manual therapy techniques and electrotherapy methods reduce the pain intensity of women with primary dysmenorrhea. Quality of life and degree of anxiety improved significantly with manual therapy interventions.

(2) Can a general increase in activity be obtained by the electrotherapeutic muscle stimulation? A test group (combined Hufschmidt/Bobath therapy) and a control group (Bobath), both consisting of 10 subjects, were observed for four months. The duration of observation was divided into two four months treatment periods with a rest interval of two months in between. At the start of therapeutic measures, motor activity and psychic condition were tested with corresponding motormetric and psychodiagnostic techniques; three check-up examinations were carried out at the end of the first, and at the beginning and end of the second period of treatment. The motor-metric control examination showed that at the end of the first period the test group had achieved by far the better results, but at the end of the second therapeutic period, both groups were equally successful. The combined electrophysiotherapy hence reached in a relatively shorter time - as it were by leaps and bounds - the optimal obtainable state of functional improvements which, with the Bobath therapy alone, can be effected more slowly but with more continuity. The psychodiagnostic controls clearly indicate that the electrical stimulation produced an unspecified increase in activity, especially after the first phase of treatment, whereas in the second phase this could only be proven in a graded form. The report closes with an examination of the results and their consequences for the implementation of the treatment for cerebral palsied children.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1085963/"}

Therefore, an effective rehabilitation programme is necessary including specific therapy forms and training concepts based on scientific findings in sports medicine, performance physiology and training sciences, in orthopaedics and traumatology as well as further medical disciplines. Determination of the load on the locomotor system and examination of cardiopulmonary capacity are important basic elements of rehabilitation training. Rehabilitation should include intense muscular and regular endurance training where loads must be tuned to the patient's individual capacity. Overuse syndromes can be avoided by planning regeneration breaks between training units and by continuously controlling the individual parameters of the patient. The costs of intense rehabilitation may at first seem high; however, one year after an operation the financial expenditures in those patients who did not receive intense rehabilitation exceeded all costs incurred for an operation and additional rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10919178/"}

Our wellness starts with good nutrition, food through the digestive system and oxygen through the respiratory system. Without proper breathing mechanisms, the brain, whose priority is to survive will unconsciously limit our ability to function properly. Adhesive capsulitis also known as 'Frozen Shoulder' affects a high number of people, with the majority found in the female population between 50 and 60 years of age. The causes are still relatively unknown; however, the effects and debilitating consequences are well known, and rehabilitative procedures can include both surgical and non-surgical interventions depending on the initial structural diagnosis. Long-periods of aggressive rehabilitative physiotherapy can be part of a program including home-exercises. This paper presents partial outcomes in a female single case report with no previous medical conditions. Following a formal adhesive capsulitis diagnosis, a therapeutic program was set out by a qualified physiotherapist following an ultrasound guided hydro-dilation steroid injection.

A societal perspective was taken and costs were included as those incurred by the health care system, the survivors and community. Health outcomes included: (a) 'rehabilitated cases' based on changes in health-related quality of life between 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis, using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer plus Arm Morbidity (FACT-B+4) questionnaire, and (b) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using utility scores from the Subjective Health Estimation (SHE) scale. Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires, medical records and program budgets. A Monte-Carlo modelling approach was used to test for uncertainty in cost and outcome estimates. The proportion of rehabilitated cases was similar across the three groups. From a societal perspective compared with the non-intervention group, the DAART intervention appeared to be the most efficient option with an incremental cost of $1344 per QALY gained, whereas the incremental cost per QALY gained from the STRETCH program was $14,478.

Eighty-six patients with total hip or knee replacements were tested at various time periods during their hospitalization. Patients were tested for five functional activities by four therapists to establish the reliability and test responsiveness. The Harris Hip Rating Scale was administered to assess the validity of the functional score. The weighted Kappa statistic supported good intratester (K = .79-.90) and moderate intertester (K = .48-.78) reliability. The correlation between the Harris Hip Rating Scale scores and the total functional scores was high (r = -.86). The total functional score was responsive to 4 days of therapy postoperatively.

However, the incorporation of evidence-based guidelines in a health care practice requires a specific, targeted approach on all organisational levels. To gain a deeper understanding of how to facilitate the implementation of coherent and evidence-based guidelines in Danish rehabilitation contexts. The study was based on a phenomenological hermeneutic approach and on theories within knowledge translation. Fifteen municipalities and four hospitals volunteered to participate. Facilitators were appointed locally. Data concerning factors facilitating the implementation were generated in three focus group interviews. Evidence-based rehabilitation was implemented with local adaptation for each participating setting, resulting in context-dependent variations. The PARIHS framework is based on concepts that capture factors of impact on clinical decision-making and interventions which enhance changes of daily practice in the participating rehabilitation settings. The rehabilitation pathways reinforced the foundation and ownership of the daily practice and created an impetus for raising the quality of clinical practice. The facilitators constituted important actors in anchoring the implementation. Moreover, it was important for the local implementation to be an integrated element of a common workforce agenda. Implications for Rehabilitation Evidence-based rehabilitation pathways updated the professional knowledge and reinforced the therapists' ownership of the daily practice. Appointed facilitators are key stakeholders and important elements in anchoring an implementation. Local implementation processes being part of a cross-sectoral enhancement support successful implementation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23614355/"}

To determine whether search quality has improved since error messages and tutorials were implemented; and evaluate the content of PEDro searches. Google Analytics was used to access all search commands on PEDro (between 1 August 2017 and 31 January 2018) and extract the following data: total number of search commands; 25 most common simple and advanced search commands; and frequency of search errors (e.g. Boolean operators) or use of sophisticated features (e.g. truncation/wildcards). Two researchers independently coded the subdiscipline (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurology) and PICO elements (Population; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome) from a random sample of 200 simple and 200 advanced search commands. Data were compared to an identical analysis performed in 2014-2015 to determine whether the content or quality of search commands had changed.

The content of PEDro search commands was largely similar to searches from 2014 to 2015. There has been a small reduction in the number of search commands containing errors, and only a very small increase in the use of sophisticated features.

Therapists were asked to define reliability and error of measurement, to estimate the error of measurement of two assessments, and to make decisions about an intervention based on specific measurements. They were also asked to rate their confidence in those decisions. Problems varied on the presence or absence of measurement information and on the difference between an observed measurement and a criterion measurement against which the observed measurement must be compared to make a decision. The response rate was 62%; respondents represented a typical profile of practicing physical therapists. The therapists understood reliability, but they did not correctly describe the relationship between reliability and error of measurement. Their estimates of the error of measurement of the two assessments were reasonable for only one procedure. The presence or absence of measurement information and difference between observed and criterion measurements affected their confidence, albeit inappropriately, in only one problem. Confidence was not affected by the therapists' level of experience, type of reading, formal study, or degree earned. Therapists responded to the two problems differently. The problems involved different measures, roles, utilities, and structures. The process of decision making does not generalize to all decision types.

In addition, a correlation was investigated between accuracy of interpretation and the number of years of specialization in the field of cardiorespiratory physical therapy. This research follows an earlier study which investigated the accuracy and inter-rater reliability of auscultating tape-recorded lung sounds in a 'non-specialized' cohort of physical therapists. The subjects were 26 'specialized' cardiorespiratory physical therapists working in acute urban teaching hospitals. These individuals were required to have been practising currently and exclusively for at least one year in the area of cardiorespiratory physical therapy. Participants listened with a stethoscope to five different sounds and identified them from a standardized list of terms. One of three tapes with the same lung sounds in different order was randomly selected for each physical therapist. The percentage of correct answers for all subjects was calculated. An accurate response in the detection of lung sounds was arbitrarily defined as a percentage of correct answers of 70% or greater. The difference between the pooled correct response rate of 50% and the arbitrarily set value of 70% was statistically significant (z = 2.23, p < 0.05), indicating that the 'specialized' physical therapists were not accurate in identifying lung sounds. There was no relationship evident between the accuracy and the number of years of cardiorespiratory 'specialization' (r = 0.08). Analysis of inter-rater reliability revealed 'fair agreement' (kappa = 0.26) among subjects.

Forty therapists working full-time in head injury rehabilitation were surveyed. Correlations between subscale scores of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (i.e., Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment) and responses to a survey of professional development activities are reported. Professional development activities are most strongly associated with feelings of personal accomplishment. Emotional exhaustion was relatively high among these therapists, but few feelings of depersonalization were evident.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to consider varying levels of experience, public versus private sector, and domestic versus international student fees. Comparable calculations were made for educational investments in medicine and nursing/midwifery. Assuming an expected discount rate of 9.675%, investment in education by domestic students with approximately 34 years of average work experience yields a NPV estimated at $784,000 for public sector physiotherapists and $815,000 for private sector therapists.

The most common means of education was on-the-job training, and the least common was higher level accredited education. A majority (71) of respondents reported that no competency testing was being performed at their facilities. In the remaining facilities (29), the majority performed competency tests with no routine frequency, using no particular guidelines for testing and no formal methods for maintaining standards for physical agent modality use.

Dichotomous outcomes (death or the combined poor outcome of death or deterioration) were analysed by use of the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Patients subjected to more intensive physiotherapy input showed a non-significant reduction in case fatality (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.33-1.09) and a significant reduction (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.34-0.85; p < 0.01) in the combined poor outcome of death or deterioration by the end of follow-up. Two statistical techniques were used to identify patterns within the continuous data. Firstly, impairment and disability scores were converted to a standardised measure of 0-100 and the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the scores in the intensive and conventional physiotherapy groups were then calculated. Modest improvements were observed in both the impairment (WMD+5; 95% CI-1-11) and disability scores (WMD+5; 95% CI 0-10) recorded at the initial review (median 3 months post-stroke), but not at the final review (median 1 year post-stroke). Secondly, Fisher's inverse chi-squared test was used to combine the p values from individual trials; this confirmed the above findings (p < 0.05 at initial review; p > 0.05 at final review). More intensive physiotherapy input was associated with a reduction in the combined poor outcome of death or deterioration and may enhance the rate of recovery. These observations warrant further investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9238725/"}

While medication mainly focus on pain reduction, physical therapy is aimed at disease consequences such as pain, fatigue, deconditioning, muscle weakness and sleep disturbances and other disease consequences. We systematically reviewed current treatment options in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials cardiovascular fitness training importantly improves cardiovascular fitness, both subjective and objective measures of pain as well as subjective energy and work capacity and physical and social activities. Based on anecdotal evidence or small observational studies physiotherapy may reduce overloading of the muscle system, improve postural fatigue and positioning, and condition weak muscles. Modalities and whole body cryotherapy may reduce localized as well as generalized pain in short term. Trigger point injection may reduce pain originating from concomitant trigger points in selected FM patient. Massage may reduce muscle tension and may be prescribed as a adjunct with other therapeutic interventions. Acupuncture may reduce pain and increase pain threshold. Biofeedback may positively influence subjective and objective disease measures. TENS may reduce localized musculoskeletal pain in fibromyalgia. While there seems to be no single best treatment option, physical therapy seem to reduce disease consequences. Accordingly a multidisciplinary approach combining these therapies in a well balanced program may be the most promising strategy and is currently recommended in the treatment of fibromyalgia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11028838/"}

Technologies have the potential to contribute but without strong clinical evidence are unlikely to be widely reimbursed. This review presents evidence of new technologies since 2008 and identifies barriers to translation of technologies into clinical practice. Technology has not been shown to be superior to intensively matched existing therapies. Research has been undertaken into the development and preliminary clinical testing of novel technologies including robotics, electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy, assistive orthoses, noninvasive brain stimulation, virtual reality and gaming devices. Translation of the research into clinical practice has been impeded by a lack of robust evidence of clinical effectiveness and usability. Underlying mechanisms associated with recovery are beginning to be explored, which may lead to more targeted interventions. Improvements in function have been demonstrated beyond the normal recovery period, but few trials demonstrate lasting effects. Technologies, alone or combined, may offer a cost-effective way to deliver intensive neurorehabilitation therapy in clinical and community environments, and have the potential to empower patients to take more responsibility for their rehabilitation and continue with long-term exercise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20962639/"}

Evidence suggests that more than 85 % of individuals with LBP suffer from non-specific low back pain. Physiotherapy for non-specific LBP includes educational, physical, manual and movement therapy measures. In the acute phase, it is very important to prevent chronicity by identifying barriers for a full recovery and a quick return to everyday activities. If there is a chronicity of symptoms, the treatment must focus on improvement of the general physical activity despite the pain and promote participation in the social and work context. These aims are more important than pain relief. Therefore in the acute phase educational and activity-promoting measures are the primary treatment options. In the sub-acute and chronic phase a multidimensional treatment approach including exercise therapy with the aim of improving function, including return to work, should be applied. By now, there is scientific evidence that physiotherapy can reduce pain and disability due to LBP, and that return to usual activities including work can be achieved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23985153/"}

Two devices, the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator (IPV) and the Flutter device (Flutter) have been promoted for this purpose. This study compares these devices to standard, manual CPT. There was no difference in sputum quantity produced with any method studied. Transiently lower oxygen saturation was noted with standard CPT compared with the IPV and Flutter. Inconsistent but significant improvements in flow rates were noted with the two devices compared to standard CPT. Important trends to lower lung volumes, probably indicating decreased air trapping, were also noted with all three therapies at 1 and 4 hours after administration.

It is a critical discourse analysis of texts in professional occupational therapist (OT) and physiotherapist (PT) journals, along with transcriptions from three focus group interviews with 25 OTs and PTs in local rehabilitation settings. Although positive attitudes towards outcome measurement were expressed in the professional journals, OTs and PTs in local settings had professional reservations about standardisation of the rehabilitation practise. The therapists were caught in what they considered to be a dilemma between taking a holistic approach and performing standardised practise. Systematic outcome measurement challenged the core values of their practise. Therapists often felt that 'it did not make sense' to use outcome measurement and this became a barrier to its implementation. If the use of standardised outcome measurement is to be increased, reflection is needed on how the measurements can be integrated to provide a meaningful contribution to individual rehabilitation processes. To optimise implementation, it is essential to make use of research in knowledge translation and adapt it to fit with the ways in which new ideas and recommendations are implemented in local rehabilitation contexts. Implications for Rehabilitation Successful implementation of standardised outcome measurements depends on whether occupational therapists and physiotherapists have an experience of the measurements as being meaningful. Enforcement of standardised outcome measurements must be done by means of more than a few isolated arguments, if professional acceptance is to be gained. To reject established dogmas on, e.g. standardisation, deliberate and conscious reflections in local settings are needed. It is necessary to go beyond normal and familiar professional reflections.

However, being of poor quality, the literature failed to provide solid evidence for or against the efficacy of physical exercises in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Nevertheless, considering that exercises could also be proposed on the basis that benefits rather than to avoid progression have been shown in the literature, and that the results contained in published studies here reviewed suggest an effect on the primary goal of preventing progression, there is a basis for discussion of this option with patients and their families, which in turn allows decisions to be made according to their preferences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14713590/"}

Primary outcome measures are general improvement, pain intensity, functional status, work absenteeism and quality of life. The direct and indirect costs will be assessed using cost diaries. Patients will complete questionnaires at baseline and 6, 13, 26 and 52 weeks after randomisation. No trials are yet available that have evaluated the effect of an intensive group training protocol including behavioural principles and back school in a primary physiotherapy care setting and no data on cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are available.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15560843/"}

The robotic device is designed as a three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) mechanism supporting the subject under the buttocks. The device is driven by an electrohydraulic servosystem capable of operating in multiple control modes. It is instrumented with a sensory system providing information about the standing-up parameters. Evaluation of the standing up assistive device was accomplished in robot-supported rising trials of a paraplegic subject. The experiments demonstrated that stable risings in different standing - up manoeuvres were achieved. The measurement results revealed the role of the arm support and the support of the artificially evoked moments in the paralysed lower extremities during rising. The results show that the device can be used efficiently for training and evaluation of standing up manoeuvres.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14965861/"}

The purpose of this brief report is to report the duration and cost of PT care, and subsequent escalation of care events, for LBP in service members with and without limb loss. This was a retrospective cohort, descriptive study. Service members with and without limb loss (matched) who received PT for LBP at a military treatment facility from 2015 to 2017 were included. Duration of PT care, number of PT visits, and escalation of care events 1 year after PT were extracted from medical records. Escalation of care events was identified as epidural steroid injections, referrals to specialists (e.g., orthopedists, spine surgeons, and pain management), and LBP-related hospitalizations.LBP-related PT encounters were queried; duration of care, number of visits, and cost of care were quantified. Escalation of care events, including opioid prescription, epidural steroid injections, specialty referrals, and hospitalizations, were identified up to 1 year after PT care. The average course of PT care for LBP was 12.9 more visits, 48.7 days longer, and $764.50 more expensive in service members with limb loss (n = 16) vs. those without limb loss (n = 48). Higher rates of opioid prescriptions and specialty referrals were observed in service members with limb loss. This study suggests that service members with limb loss and LBP received higher quantities and longer durations of PT than those without limb loss, yielding a nearly 4 times higher cost of PT.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39367785/"}

A literature search was based on 19 Cochrane reviews and 26 other reviews. We also updated the searches in PubMed up to September 30, 2017. Randomized controlled trials associated with 18 experimented training programs (ETP) were included if they evaluated the effects of the programs on either upper extremity (UE) or lower extremity (LE) motor recovery among adults within 6 months poststroke; included ≥10 participants in each arm; and had an intervention duration of ≥10 consecutive weekdays. Four reviewers evaluated the eligibility and quality of literature. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Among the 178 included studies, 129 including 7450 participants were analyzed in this meta-analysis. Six ETPs were significantly effective in enhancing UE motor recovery, with the standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals outlined as follow: constraint-induced movement therapy (0.82, 0.45-1.19), electrostimulation (ES)-motor (0.42, 0.22-0.63), mirror therapy (0.71, 0.22-1.20), mixed approach (0.21, 0.01-0.41), robot-assisted training (0.51, 0.22-0.80), and task-oriented training (0.57, 0.16-0.99). Six ETPs were significantly effective in enhancing LE motor recovery: body-weight-supported treadmill training (0.27, 0.01-0.52), caregiver-mediated training (0.64, 0.20-1.08), ES-motor (0.55, 0.27-0.83), mixed approach (0.35, 0.15-0.54), mirror therapy (0.56, 0.13-1.00), and virtual reality (0.60, 0.15-1.05).

The predominant use of therapeutic ultrasound is in relation to tissue repair and soft tissue lesion management, where the evidence would support its application in the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling phases. The clinical outcomes appear to be dose dependent, and whilst this paper does not detail dose related clinical decision making, the broad issues are considered.

For the characterisation, reference as well as routine testing methods are described. Important parameters such as effective radiating area (AER), beam nonuniformity ratio (RBN) (characterising 'hot-spots': potentially harmful to patients) and beam type have been re-defined. The quality, reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of AER are significantly improved compared to those in IEC 150 (which is now replaced) and the FDA 1050.10 (USA) standards. As a result, values of effective intensity are shown to be significantly higher than those obtained using the FDA 1050.10 (USA) definitions. As it may be expected that the new standard will be implemented worldwide, this problem is just a matter of time. The standard discussed above specifies the need for acoustic power measurement with an accuracy of more than 15%. However, several investigations carried out over the last ten years show a lack of proper facilities to calibrate the acoustic output power at physiotherapy levels. A project to investigate the complications and to produce definitive guidance for therapy-level power measurements is funded by the EC and has been started recently.

The purposes of the current study are: 1) to determine how the variance in the number of physical therapy treatment sessions in patients with non-specific low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands is distributed over patient level, therapist level and practice level; and 2) to determine the factors that explain the variance. Data were used from a national registration network on physical therapy. Our database contained information on 1,733 patients referred with LBP, treated by 97 therapists working in 41 practices. The variation in the number of treatment sessions was investigated by means of multilevel regression analyses. Eighty-eight per cent of the variation in the number of treatment sessions for patients with LBP is located at patient level and seven per cent is located at practice level. It was possible to explain thirteen per cent of all variance. The duration of the complaint, prior therapy, and the patients' age and gender in particular are related to the number of physical therapy treatment sessions. Our results suggest that the number of physical therapy treatment sessions in patients with LBP mainly depends on patient characteristics. More variation needs to be explained, however, to improve the transparency of care.

To study this, we prospectively studied 50 CF patients admitted for acute pulmonary exacerbation who were randomly allocated to receive either HFCC or CPT three times a day. On admission, clinical status and pulmonary function tests (PFT) in the HFCC group were not significantly different from those measured in the CPT group. Significant improvements in clinical status and PFT were observed after 7 and 14 d of treatment, and were similar in the two study groups, leading to patient discharge after similar periods of hospitalization.

Scores for these six therapist groups were examined on three variables generally considered to be associated with the development of expertise--motivation, openness to experience (as defined by the critical-thinking dispositions of truth-seeking, open-mindedness, and cognitive maturity), and features of their clinical caseload experience (i.e. breadth of experience as measured by number of different client age groups worked with, the complexity of clients' needs, and experience in delivering services to adolescents, school-age children, preschoolers, and infants). Low-experience experts ('young stars') had the highest motivation, truth-seeking, and open-mindedness scores of all groups, the highest percentage of clients with complex service needs, and were more likely to work with adolescents.

This requires additional costs in the form of increased physiotherapist time. The objective of this economic analysis is to determine the cost-effectiveness of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy (duration and/or frequency) during inpatient rehabilitation after stroke, from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care. The inputs for our economic evaluation were extracted from articles published in peer-reviewed journals and from reports from government sources or the Canadian Stroke Network. Where published data were not available, we sought expert opinion and used inputs based on the experts' estimates. The primary outcome we considered was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We also evaluated functional strength training because of its similarities to physiotherapy. We used a 2-state Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of functional strength training and increased physiotherapy intensity for stroke inpatient rehabilitation. The model had a lifetime timeframe with a 5% annual discount rate. We then used sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the model inputs. We found that functional strength training and higher-intensity physiotherapy resulted in lower costs and improved outcomes over a lifetime. However, our sensitivity analyses revealed high levels of uncertainty in the model inputs, and therefore in the results. There is a high level of uncertainty in this analysis due to the uncertainty in model inputs, with some of the major inputs based on expert panel consensus or expert opinion. In addition, the utility outcomes were based on a clinical study conducted in the United Kingdom (i.e., 1 study only, and not in an Ontario or Canadian setting).

Accordingly, many investigators have used walking track analysis as an assessment of global functional recovery following sciatic, peroneal or tibial nerve injury. However, walking track reliability may be compromised by the development of flexion contractures secondary to neurologic loss. To prevent this, regular manual physiotherapy is recommended which is a time-consuming and often frustrating process for both the animal and investigator. We report the use of a wire mesh as a simple post-operative assistive device to provide constant physiotherapy. Twelve Lewis rats were randomized to one of two experimental groups. Each rat received a 2 cm posterior tibial nerve autograft. Postoperatively, animals in group 1 received manual physiotherapy, consisting of repeated flexion and extension exercises of the ankle, knee and hip every two weeks. Group 2 rats were permitted to climb freely on a 30 x 18 cm piece of wire mesh placed at a 45 degree angle within their cage. Group 2 rats received no manual physiotherapy throughout the course of the study. Serial walking tracks were performed every four weeks until sacrifice at sixteen weeks. There was no development of flexion contractures in the injured hind limbs of either group. There was no morbidity such as blisters associated with the use of the wire mesh. There was no statistical difference in walking track recovery between groups at any time period. However, a trend towards better functional recovery was seen in the group receiving constant physiotherapy via the wire mesh. The use of a wire mesh as a post-operative assistive device is an inexpensive, simple and reliable method to provide continuous physiotherapy to animals following denervation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10970122/"}

There are a number of other rehabilitation problems--bladder dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and pain, to name a few--that are important to address in the rehabilitation of a patient with MS, but that were not covered in this review. I would like to stress the principle that we need to adapt rehabilitation strategies to a progressive neurologic disease with an uncertain future course. That means we need to \"overrehabilitate\" MS patients with exacerbating and remitting unstable disease. As an example of what this means, consider a patient who has an EDSS of 4.5 and has a certain level of function. Suppose the patient receives a rehabilitative course and functions well. However the patient may have an exacerbation and become worse, going to an EDSS of 6.5, which may or may not improve. During this period, this patient needs to be able to function at his or her more impaired level. Therefore, it is important to train patients in therapeutic strategies they can use if they become temporarily worse. We need to remember that all organ system problems exist in a singular patient. Consequently, we must coordinate all of the treatments together, because the whole system must work for the patient as a whole.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9697086/"}

Whilst exercises are routinely used in a number of central and southern European countries, most centres in the rest of the world (mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries), do not advocate its use. One of the reasons for this is that many health care professionals are usually not conversant with the differences between generalised physiotherapy exercises and physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE): while the former are generic exercises usually consisting of low-impact stretching and strengthening activities like yoga, Pilates and the Alexander technique, PSSE consist of a program of curve-specific exercise protocols which are individually adapted to a patients' curve site, magnitude and clinical characteristics. PSSEs are performed with the therapeutic aim of reducing the deformity and preventing its progression. It also aims to stabilise the improvements achieved with the ultimate goal of limiting the need for corrective braces or the necessity of surgery.

Regular physical therapy with trained physiotherapists is recommended in the guidelines. Recently, digital physical therapy offered by digital health interventions was shown to be effective. However, the evidence on its real-world usage in health care systems is limited. Based on claims data, this study examined the current usage of digital health applications (DiGAs) for musculoskeletal disorders in the German health care system. Patients with standalone digital physical therapy were compared to those with a combination of analog and digital physical therapy. In addition, predictors for concomitant use were identified. This retrospective cohort study analyzed claims data from Germany's largest statutory health insurance. Patients who used DiGA for musculoskeletal disorders at least once were included. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients receiving standalone and concomitant physical therapy were compared. Statistical analyses comprised univariate analyses and binomial logistic regression. Of the 6090 individuals, 58.2% (3543/6090) were prescribed physical therapy within 6 months before or after DiGA prescription. In this population, 36.3% (2210/6090) used DiGA and analog physical therapy at the same time. Concomitant physical therapy was significantly more likely in patients with chronicity risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.31-1.69; P<.001) or established chronicity (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.22-3.47; P<.001), female gender (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.33-1.66; P<.001), and higher age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02; P<.001).

Videotaped encounters between two patients and their physiotherapists were analysed in depth to try to answer this question. It is advocated that attention must not be restricted to either clinical decision making or communication, but needs to be directed towards the relationship between communication and diagnostic approaches. In other words, in order to understand how a health problem is defined, the complexity and social organization of the process of interaction cannot be ignored. Therapies are chosen and cooperation is built on such socially and professionally constructed basis, and it is suggested that the nature of this construction needs to be grasped. To this end, the author analyses both the therapists' examination and the communication between patient and therapist. Focus is thereby shifted from the 'pure' diagnostic activity to the frame of reference underlying it. The analysis demonstrates differences in the two therapists' practice from the very moment patient and therapist greet one another till they say farewell. The therapists' actions mirror the dissimilar conceptual frameworks underlying their practice, and the therapists' conceptual lenses therefore need to be scrutinized further.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1505710/"}

Retrospective case series. Outpatient settings at a tertiary care facility. Patients (N=220) who were seen for PT between June 2003 and November 2005. A customized rehabilitation program was developed for each patient based on examination findings and included a combination of the following interventions: mobilization or manipulation, flexibility exercises, strengthening exercises, endurance exercises, massage techniques, and heat and cold modalities. Functional outcome, functional improvement, perceived pain, and perceived improvement scores in the CareConnections Outcomes System (formerly TAOS) database. Persons whose symptom duration was greater than 6 months (chronic group) had significantly less functional improvement than persons whose symptom duration was less than 1 month (acute group). The median percentage improvement score for patient perceived recovery was also significantly lower for the chronic group than for the acute group. There was no significant difference in the percentage decrease in pain among the acute, subacute (symptom duration, 1-6 mo), and chronic groups. In regression analyses, a model with age (P=.001), symptom duration (P=.05), and inclusion of mobilization and manipulation interventions (P=.02) fit the data well and explained 35.6% of the variance in functional outcome score for all 3 groups combined.

A repeated measures design was used to record fifteen pre-palpated landmarks on the back of each subject. To limit the sources of variability, the principal researcher palpated the landmarks for each subject. Each of three raters took two measurements on each subject in a standardized upright posture. X (medio-lateral), Y (antero-posterior) and Z (height) landmark positions were recorded via a computer interface. Both intra-rater agreement (mean ICCs - rater 1 r=0.970, rater 2 r=0.965 and rater 3 r=0.965, p< 0.001) and inter-rater agreement (mean ICCs r=0.967, p< 0.001) was very high between repeated measures and between markers.

Breathing exercises (RE), bronchial drainage and controlled coughing are all part of current techniques in physiotherapy. As problems with the rhythm of breathing are frequently encountered in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, their correction is attempted with KR. In order to acquire a new, more efficient breathing pattern, training in simple every day measures is used (such as talking, reading watching TV, walking, climbing stairs, etc.) or techniques using mechanical devices, including inventive spirometers and magnetometers. With a few exceptions, most of the studies show an immediate objective benefit on blood gases and alveolar ventilation, due to a reduced respiratory rate and increased tidal volume. Although dynamic ventilatory work increases, neither the pulmonary haemodynamics nor energy expenditure are altered as judged by oxygen consumption during RE. The long term results are contradictory and more difficult to interpret. Many studies have noted a clinical and functional improvement with fewer relapses and hospital admissions; these studies often lack adequate controls and the clinical state is not always precisely defined; nor whether associated therapy has been changed or not. Other studies have given negative results, and lately the causes of these failures have been better defined. There is insufficient theoretical and practical training of KR at all medical levels, an absence of uniformity in the KR rehabilitation teams, and treatment courses which are both too few in number and too short in duration.

Using a consecutive sampling strategy, 100 stroke survivors attending an outpatient Neurology clinic in a Ghanaian tertiary medical center were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. After collecting basic demographic data, clinical history on stroke type, severity and level of disability, we administered the validated 20-item Functional Independence Measure questionnaire to evaluate functional status of study participants and an 8-item questionnaire to assess participants' attitudes towards telemedicine administered rehabilitation intervention. Mean±SD age of study participants was 57.2±13.3years of which 51.0% were males with a mean duration of stroke of 1.3±2.2years. 53% had Modified Rankin scores of ≥3, 57% were fully independent and only 27% reported utilizing any physiotherapy services. Barriers to access to physiotherapy included financial constraints due to cost of physiotherapy services and transportation as well as premature discharge from physiotherapy to avoid overburdening of available physiotherapy services. These factors led to the limited provision of rehabilitative therapy. Participants held positive views of the potential for tele-rehabilitation interventions (80-93%). However, while 85% owned mobile phones, only 35% had smart phones. Despite, a high burden of residual disability, only about 1 out of 4 stroke patients in this Ghanaian cohort was exposed to post-stroke physiotherapy services, largely due to relatively high costs and limited health system resources. These Ghanaian stroke patients viewed the potential role of Tele-rehabilitation as positive, but this promising intervention needs to be formally tested for feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28991682/"}

Managing the pediatric patient requires experience and the appreciation of the contributions of health, social and educational professionals: physician, nurse, occupational therapist, learning specialist, recreational therapist, psychologist, social worker, and physical therapist. The responsibility of this multidisciplinary team is to assist the family and the child in attaining the highest realistic physical independence, to prevent musculoskeletal deformity and, therefore, to improve the overall quality of life. Successful rehabilitation will depend on the degree to which each professional considers the whole child when working to alleviate specific handicaps. The long-term rehabilitation of the pediatric patient is a joint team-family responsibility, and for treatment to be translated into daily life, full cooperation and commitment from the family is crucial. The physician is the coordinator of the rehabilitation team and is responsible for the initial assessment and diagnosis from which the team undertakes appropriate management. Ideally, the physician and team members communicate frequently to ensure congruent goals of treatment. The role of the physical therapist in the management of the pediatric rehabilitation patient relates to classifications of diagnosis. The authors present this guide to families and health professionals for using physical therapy resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2259680/"}

The aims of the study were (a) to describe the current use of measurement instruments by physiotherapists working in Germany and (b) to investigate the facilitators and barriers to use measurement instruments. This cross-sectional study used a nationwide online survey, which was accessible to all physiotherapists working in Germany. In total, 522 adult physiotherapists working in Germany completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 38 years, 63% were female, and 53% had >10 years of work experience. Thirty-one percent of the respondents used measurement instruments in ≥80% of their patients, and 26% used measurement instruments in ≤20%. Measurement instruments were used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes by 69% and 22% of respondents, respectively. The three most frequently reported measurement instruments were \"goniometer\" (n = 254), some kind of a \"visual/numeric analogue scale\" (n = 139), and the \"manual examination of muscle-strength\" (n = 54). Seven of the 13 most stated measurement instruments measure activities or participation. The most important facilitator was physiotherapists' positive attitudes towards measurement instruments. Two out of three respondents reported having sufficient knowledge and skills to apply measurement instruments in clinical practice. The most pronounced barriers were insufficient additional financial compensations and requiring extra time to document test scores. Seventy-eight percent of the respondents could imagine using an electronic device for a user-friendly patient health record system in clinical practice. The limited use of measurement instruments reported by physiotherapists working in Germany appears to be due to organisational issues, in combination with a lack of knowledge and skills needed to apply the measurement instruments, rather than due to individual or managerial reasons. To support the use of measurement instruments, sufficient time resources and adequate financial compensation are required. Educational approaches should focus on imparting patient-centred and patient-reported outcomes to quantify activities and participation. Electronic patient health record systems have potential to facilitate the application of standardised measurement instruments if the barriers identified in this survey are addressed properly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30352584/"}

IFOMPT aims and works for global promotion of excellence and unity in clinical and academic standards for manual/musculoskeletal physiotherapists. This dissertation reflects on some of IFOMPT's initiatives and achievements as an international organisation in its first 50 years as well as challenges for next 50 years. IFOMPT has achieved in several initiatives. These include the development of an international educational curriculum in manipulative/musculoskeletal physiotherapy which underpins education standards for membership. Educational standards for membership is a relatively unique requirement of a professional organisation. IFOMPT has achieved in developing several initiatives to disseminate knowledge for best standards of practice for its members and the wider community. The pinnacle is its four yearly international scientific conferences where the latest issues in both research and practice are presented and discussed. IFOMPT has also developed frameworks to guide clinical practice in key areas for safe practice - vascular pathologies of the neck, a clinical reasoning pathway to identify 'red flags', and the use of spinal manipulation in paediatrics. Other resources include on-line lectures, podcasts and research reviews. IFOMPT has challenges for the future. These include increasing the number of member countries and further establishing its profile and position of leadership in manual/musculoskeletal physiotherapy in the international context, particularly with decision makers in world health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39002994/"}

However, up to 80% of individuals who are prescribed at-home physiotherapy do not consistently adhere to their treatment schedule, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. This is likely due to a lack of motivation and progress tracking in the current standard of care. We have developed a novel software prototype that allows users to control commercial entertainment content, such as video games or interactive music videos, with their movements during physiotherapy. By connecting therapy to proven entertainment content, we aim to improve on the current motivational deficits. This study investigated the safety and feasibility of this concept in a controlled environment over four physical therapy sessions with seven patients suffering from musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. As a secondary outcome, patients were asked about their enjoyment, perceived competence and effort using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire. All participants were able to interact with the presented entertainment content and completed the study with no adverse events. Despite the diversity in pathology, age and training scenarios, the entertainment content maintained the patients' enjoyment with a high average rate of 6/7 on the IMI scale. Interacting with commercial entertainment content by doing physical therapy exercises was feasible, safe, and well-received over the six-week study period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37941172/"}

Ratio-scaled data are necessary, for example, to report muscle performance characteristics in terms of ratios or percentages or in the form of ratios with another muscle (eg, ratio of hamstring to quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque). The purpose of this study was to determine the error associated with the gravity-correction procedure of the Kin-Com dynamometer when a weight or limb segment is weighed at different lever arm positions. A known weight was suspended from the lever arm of the Kin-Com dynamometer. The rotational component of gravitational forces on the weight was measured at 11 different angular positions. We compared the force measurement obtained from the Kin-Com with the predicted rotational component at each angular position. The gravitational forces on a subject's limb segment (leg) were then measured at 12 different angular positions in each of two trunk positions (sitting and supine). We compared the force measurement obtained from the Kin-Com with the predicted rotational component for each position. Forces measured for the two trunk positions with the lever arm horizontal were compared. Forces measured with the knee extended were compared with forces measured with the lever arm horizontal. The dynamometer accurately recorded the rotational component of gravitational forces for the weight suspended from the lever arm. There was a progressively greater discrepancy between measured forces and predicted forces for the leg as the lever arm was moved from horizontal to 50 degrees below the horizontal. The force recorded with the Kin-Com was greater when the subject's knee was in full extension than when the lever arm was horizontal, which placed the subject's knee in a flexed position. A small difference was noted between the measured forces with the lever arm horizontal when the subject was sitting compared with when the subject was positioned supine. When weighing a leg with this dynamometer, we recommend that the lever arm be as close to the horizontal position as possible. Positions of proximal joints should be chosen that do not put two joint muscles in stretched positions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7991654/"}

DA showed less number of physiotherapy treatments, visits to physician, imaging performed and required fewer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and secondary care. Patients were more satisfied with the service in comparison to the group referred by the physician. and costs per subject were lower. DA patients were younger, with a higher level of education; mostly, they presented a less severe clinical condition and a more acute pathologies related to the spine. No harms were reported.

Other states have enacted direct access legislation enabling consumers to obtain physical therapy without a physician referral. Critics of direct access cite potential overutilization of services, increased costs, and inappropriate care. Using paid claims data for the period 1989 to 1993 from Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Maryland, a direct access state, we compiled episodes of physical therapy for acute musculoskeletal disorders and categorized them as direct access (n = 252) or physician referral (n = 353) using algorithms devised by a clinician advisory panel. Relative to physician referral episodes, direct access episodes encompassed fewer numbers of services (7.6 versus 12.2 physical therapy office visits) and substantially less cost ($1,004 versus $2,236). Direct access episodes were shorter, encompassed fewer numbers of services, and were less costly than those classified as physician referral episodes. There are several potential reasons why this may be the case, such as lower severity of the patient's condition, overutilization of services by physicians, and underutilization of services by physical therapists. Concern that direct access will result in overutilization of services or will increase costs appears to be unwarranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8996459/"}

Originally, approaches were based on empirical experience, but growing evidence suggests that exercise-dependent plasticity constitutes the main mechanism underlying the effects of physiotherapy. Exercise increases synaptic strength and influences neurotransmission, thus potentiating functional circuitry in PD. In addition, exercise is a pivotal element of motor learning. PD patients retain a sufficient capacity of motor learning, though learning rates and performance are reduced in comparison to normal controls. Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that rehabilitation could induce short-lasting, but clinically important benefits, particularly for gait and balance. However, the interventions are largely heterogeneous (stretching, muscle strengthening, balance, postural exercises, occupational therapy, cueing, treadmill training), and there is still no consensus about the optimal approach. Innovative techniques have been recently proposed: virtual reality and exergaming, motor imagery and action observation, robot-assisted physiotherapy and non-conventional therapies (e.g.: dance, martial arts). The rehabilitative program for PD should be \"goal-based\" (targeted to practicing and learning specific activities in the core areas), but a number of practice variables (intensity, specificity, complexity) need to be identified and the program should tailored to the individual patients' characteristics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26360239/"}

Fifty patients, first-time supratentorial stroke, stroke interval less than six weeks, Barthel Index (0-100) from 50 to 80, able to walk a minimum distance of 12 m with either intermittent help or stand-by while walking, cardiovascular stable, minimum 50 W in the bicycle ergometry, randomly allocated to two groups, A and B. Group A 30 min of treadmill training, harness secured and minimally supported according to patients' needs, and 30 min of physiotherapy, every workday for six weeks, speed and inclination of the treadmill were adjusted to achieve a heart rate of HR: (Hrmax-HRrest)*0.6+HRrest; in group B 60 min of daily physiotherapy for six weeks. Primary outcome variables were the absolute improvement of walking velocity (m/s) and capacity (m), secondary were gross motor function including walking ability (score out of 13) and walking quality (score out of 41), blindly assessed before and after the intervention, and at follow-up three months later. Patients tolerated the aerobic training well with no side-effects, significantly greater improvement of walking velocity and capacity both at study end (p =0.001 versus p =0.002) and at follow-up (p <0.001 versus p <0.001) in the experimental group. Between weeks 0 and 6, the experimental group improved walking speed and capacity by a mean of.31 m/s and 91 m, the control group by a mean of 0.16 m/s and 56 m. Between weeks 0 and 18, the experimental group improved walking speed and capacity by a mean of 0.36 m/s and 111 m, the control group by a mean of 0.15 m/s and 57 m.

To quantitatively examine the effects of WBV on muscle oxygenation and peripheral blood flow in healthy adults. We searched Web of Science and PubMed databases and reference lists from relevant articles using the key terms whole body vibration, whole-body vibration, WBV, blood flow, peripheral blood flow, oxygenation, muscle oxygenation, circulation, circulatory, near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS, and power Doppler. Key terms were searched using single word and combination searches. No date range was specified. Criteria for inclusion were (1) use of a commercially available WBV device, (2) a human research model, (3) a pre-WBV condition and at least 1 WBV experimental condition, and (4) reporting of unstandardized means and standard deviations of muscle oxygenation or peripheral blood flow. Means, standard deviations, and sample sizes were extracted from the text, tables, and figures of included studies. A total of 35 and 90 data points were extracted for the muscle-oxygenation and blood-flow meta-analyses, respectively. Data for each meta-analysis were combined and analyzed using meta-analysis software. Weighted, random-effects meta-analyses using the Hedges g metric were completed for muscle oxygenation and blood flow. We then conducted follow-up analyses using the moderator variables of vibration type, vibration time, vibration frequency, measurement location, and sample type. We found 18 potential articles. Further examination yielded 10 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Whole-body vibration was shown to positively influence peripheral blood flow. Additionally, the moderators of vibration type and frequency altered the influence of WBV on blood flow. Overall, WBV did not alter muscle oxygenation; however, when the measurement site was considered, muscle oxygenation increased or decreased depending on the location. Acute bouts of WBV increase peripheral blood flow but do not alter skeletal muscle oxygenation. Vibration type appears to be the most important factor influencing both muscle oxygenation and peripheral blood flow.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974682/"}

Clinical trials in progress and future research priorities are outlined. Expert opinion: On the balance of available evidence, exercise is likely to assist in improving physical fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and may be associated with a slower rate of decline in respiratory function in CF. Limitations to current studies include small sample sizes, study durations insufficient to achieve a training effect and difficulty distinguishing the effects of exercise training from that of other interventions implemented as part of a package of care.

For measuring inter-tester reliability, all the tests were carried out twice on the same day separately by two physiotherapists. Intra-tester reliability was assessed by reproducing the tests after 3 days by the same physiotherapist. The present study revealed satisfactory inter- and intra-tester reliability indices in different positions. ICCs for intra-tester reliability ranged from 0.65 to 0.98 and 0.59 to 0.81 for healthy and patient participants, respectively. Also, ICCs for inter-tester reliability ranged from 0.65 to 0.92 for the healthy and 0.65 to 0.87 for patient participants. In general, it can be inferred from the results that measuring the kinematic parameters in lumbar movements using inertial sensors enjoys acceptable reliability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210852/"}

The Northern Studies Stream of McMaster University's School of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy in Ontario, Canada developed a project that combined students from the occupational therapy and physiotherapy programs for small group tutorials held during clinical placements. The project incorporated suggestions from the literature in order to encourage cooperation and interdisciplinary learning. Participants were mature, second-degree students with similar levels of clinical experience. The sessions were a required part of the academic course, but were ungraded. Tutorials focused on issues relevant to clinical practice for both groups and were facilitated by faculty from both professions. Evaluation was positive, suggesting student characteristics (eg, level of experience and maturity) and session design features that may be helpful in planning future interdisciplinary education experiences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7995782/"}

When physiotherapy is first of all understood as regulation therapy, then the thermotherapy is a nearly causal element in the total therapy concept of disturbances of the acral blood supply and of cutaneous microangiopathies. Among the thermotherapy the hydrotherapy occupies the first place in efficacy, universal practicability and irritation dosage of physiotherapeutic measures. It should be a constituent of every information for vascular training. Under this aspect also the therapeutic classification of the sauna bath is to be performed. On principle the intensity of irritation of the individual treatment and the series of treatment should stand in the reverse relation to the degree of severity of the disease. The apparative-bound physiotherapy is performed in series in policlinical departments. Particular attention is paid in this case to electrotherapy, last not least also on account of favourable conditions as to working economy. The spa-therapy connects the various therapy disciplines in the framework of an indication-orientated complex therapy, in which dominate the balneo-climatotherapy and the physiotherapy. While nearly all peripheral functional disturbances of the blood supply react favourably to measures providing warmth supply, in the erythromelalgy pathological warmth sensitiveness is existing, which renders necessary a removal of heat. The heat desensitisation demands particular caution in temperature-increasing therapies. All organic manifestations (Raynaud's disease stage II, diabetic microangiopathy among others) restrict the reactivity to temperature irritations, so that the warmth supply must be performed particularly protractedly, or only still segmentally effective physiotherapeutic techniques are used.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6603073/"}

Evidence-based efficacy of different modalities for treatment of musculoskeletal pain is presented, and the value of the patient's active participation in the rehabilitation programme is emphasized. The following modalities are commonly included in the holistic approach to patient-centred care and are reviewed: exercise therapy, thermotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage and yoga. A review of cognitive-behavioural strategies in pain management to prevent or treat fear-avoidance behaviour is also presented. Furthermore, the application of biomechanics in treating and preventing musculoskeletal disorders is illustrated. Moreover, the evidence for pain self-management to improve symptoms, health status and decrease the utilization of health care resources and cost is outlined. Finally, an overview will be presented, concerning the application of the evidence for treatment modalities to patient care, with focus on patient-centred, holistic treatment in a supportive setting. The following key questions/issues are addressed. What are the relevant therapeutic modalities for musculoskeletal pain disorders? What is the evidence of efficacy of these modalities in regional musculoskeletal conditions? What is the importance of understanding biomechanics? What is the importance of understanding fear-avoidance beliefs? What is the evidence for 'alternative' therapies such as acupuncture, massage or yoga? What is the evidence for 'pain self-management?'

Understanding the benefits and costs of care is crucial to maintaining or improving existing health care systems. We propose an instrument that provides a clear overview of both the costs and returns of a treatment to improve the quality of care while keeping the costs affordable. First, a general value-based healthcare concept was developed as an efficacy index. Second, a Physiotherapy-specific Efficacy Index (PE-<sub>Index</sub>) for musculoskeletal disorders was formulated based on pain and functional improvement, treatments, and episode duration. The PE-<sub>Index </sub>discriminative value was assessed using a linear mixed model with physiotherapy practices as a random effect in real-world data from a national registry. Variation attributed to practices was quantified by an intraclass correlation coefficient. Separate linear mixed models and a radar plot (PE-<sub>Graph</sub>) visualized individual PE-<sub>Index</sub> components. Lastly, stakeholders evaluated the PE-<sub>Index</sub> and PE-<sub>Graph</sub> for internal quality improvement and external transparency through surveys and advisory board meetings. In total, 95.805 episodes treated in 370 practices were included in the linear mixed models. The PE-<sub>Index</sub> demonstrated an adequate discriminative ability with an ICC of 0.118. Stakeholders agree that the PE-<sub>Index</sub> and the PE-<sub>Chart</sub> are appropriate for improvement of quality of care and enhancing the current system for external transparency. Nevertheless, because of concerns about a too hasty implementation and the risk of strategic gaming, both were not considered suitable for external transparency right now. The PE-<sub>Index</sub> and PE-<sub>Graph</sub> are adequate instruments to discriminate between practices and can be used for internal quality improvement, however, are not yet suitable for external transparency purposes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40817216/"}

Patient perspectives are critical to review the acceptance of this model of care and potential for expansion into primary care. This study aimed to explore the clinical journeys, and the experiences and perceptions of patients attending APP services. Semi-structured interviews (n = 10) were conducted with patients across two hospital sites, with narrative data subjected to a thematic analysis. MSK journeys were mapped via medical chart and interview data, with surveys collecting demographics. Patient journeys involved multiple contact points and some duplication in MSK health services. Overall, experiences of the APP service were positive, with faster access into the hospital system and patients valued the interpersonal and professional skills of the APP. Having already attended a physiotherapist, some patients did have a preconception of what the APP could offer them. However, initial concerns were mitigated following the APP appointment, as the APP had extensive MSK knowledge. Hospitals remained the preferred location for MSK appointments due to availability of diagnostics and 'specialists', and close proximity of the doctor. Patients were positive about the new MSK APP service and benefits related to shorter wait times and seeing a specialist who listened and involved them in their management. However, a cultural shift regarding patient perceptions of the 'specialists' in hospitals and the role of a physiotherapist is required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31731056/"}

A postal questionnaire was sent to 300 UK manipulative therapists who were members of two professional associations representing differing approaches to manual therapy: the Society of Orthopaedic Medicine (SOM) and the Manipulation Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (MACP). A 50% response rate was achieved and 129 respondents identified themselves as 'users' of manipulation. Anxiety about possible complications was a prominent reason adduced by 'non-users' and 'partial users' for their avoidance of manipulative procedures. The thoracic spine was the region most often manipulated, followed by the lumbar spine. Nineteen per cent of users had encountered complications from manipulation, which were most common in the cervical region and were predominantly non-serious. The majority of SOM members and a minority of MACP members used generalized cervical rotary manipulations--thought by some to be potentially dangerous. Attitudes to manipulation were generally positive, although overall respondents were uncertain as to whether its benefits outweighed its risks. Members of the SOM emerged as more frequent users of manipulation and as less conservative in their attitudes to certain aspects of manipulation. Allowing for possible under-reporting or other response biases, spinal manipulation emerged as a relatively safe and widely practised technique among this sample.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9782522/"}

In recent years, the repetitive execution of identical movements has been demonstrated to be crucial for the recovery of arm and hand function in stroke patients. The present study aimed at investigating the efficiency of repetitive training in a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome due to an occlusion of the basilar artery. Seven months after the brainstem lesion and after a 15-week period of standard inpatient therapy, the repetitive training was applied to the (most affected) right upper extremity in addition to usual therapy. After 42 weeks of the repetitive training for the right arm, it was applied to the left arm. The ranges of active motion as well as functional motor capacity and muscle tone were regularly assessed. During those phases when the repetitive sensorimotor training was applied to the right or left arm, the ranges of active motion, muscle strength and functional motor capacity of the trained arm increased significantly accompanied by a continuous normalization of muscle tone in the flexor muscle groups. Since the prominent functional improvements of the right and left arms were observed during those phases when the repetitive training was applied, these effects were likely to be due to the training rather than to the standard rehabilitation program or extraneous influences. The repetitive sensorimotor training, therefore, appears to be appropriate to improve motor function of the arm and hand and to accelerate the time course of recovery even in patients with almost complete central paralysis of both arms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10599903/"}

To date there is no strong evidence to support conservative or surgical treatment options. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the more effective non-interventional rehabilitative treatments for the management of groin pain in athletes and, if possible, provide guidelines useful for clinical practice. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Scopus, Web of Science, Google and Google Scholar. Databases were investigated from January 1997 until March 2017. The results reported in the randomized clinical trial studies highlight that active treatment is better than passive treatment to improve clinical signs of groin pain. Comparing the active strategy with multi-modal treatment the latter allows a faster return to sport activity. Although the evidence remains poor, all the included literature highlights that an integrated strategy which combines active and passive treatment, the assessment of perceived pain, a return to running program and specific-sport exercises is an effective strategy for management of groin pain in athletes. Although we shed some light on common key aspects able to improve the typical signs of groin pain, on the basis of available data we were unable to provide practice guidelines.

{"id": "22632703", "title": "Physical therapy in persons with osteoarthritis.", "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal pain and disability. According to a study by Lawrence et al, an estimated 27 million Americans were living with OA in 2008. This number will continue to increase as the population of persons older than 65 years grows. Because of the increasing number of persons who have this chronic condition that causes pain and decreases function, the prevalence of this diagnosis in primary care and musculoskeletal clinics likely will increase. The reduction of pain and improvement in function should be goals of providers who treat these patients. Physical therapy (PT) is a commonly used treatment modality for persons with OA. Many treatment modalities are available within the scope of PT, including strength training, manual therapy, aquatic therapy, electrical stimulation, and balance and perturbation training. A review of the most recent and highest-quality literature regarding these modalities found that strength training, aquatic therapy, and balance and perturbation therapy were the most beneficial with respect to reducing pain and improving function. Evidence clearly indicates that electrical stimulation likely has very little impact on these variables, and evidence regarding manual therapy is equivocal. Literature reviewing prognostic indicators for persons with OA who will likely respond to PT reveal that persons with milder disease (ie, unilateral OA, symptoms for less than 1 year, and a 40-m self-paced walking test of less than 25.9 seconds) and those who have pain of 6 or greater on the numerical pain rating scale are likely to have better outcomes with PT, which suggests that earlier referral is preferable. Barriers to the acceptance of PT as a therapeutic treatment for OA include fatalistic patient and provider perspectives, inadequate analgesia, and a fear among some patients and providers that increased activity will lead to progression of their OA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22632703/"}

Meta-regression showed that 35% of the variance in trial outcome was explained by the measurement tool (objective or subjective) and 23% by age. None of the variances were associated with a specific dosage in terms of frequency, time, exercise duration, or the severity of the disability. Active physiotherapy seems to increase objective physical activity in community-dwelling stroke survivors. However, the evidence is of very low certainty.

Surgery alone may not return the animal to its previous physical activity or work-related tasks, whether due to concurrent soft tissue trauma, arthrogenic muscle inhibition or osteoarthritis. Rehabilitation therapies following surgery can restore function as well as strength, coordination and balance. Many simple techniques such as cryotherapy and passive range of motion exercises have been shown to improve outcomes following musculoskeletal procedures and may help restore function as well as reduce pain and facilitate healing. Some techniques are more useful during different stages in order to achieve optimum tissue healing and recovery of function. During the first 72 hours, rehabilitation should focus on reduction of inflammation and pain, maintaining joint nutrition and range of motion, and stimulating vascularisation and healing; and may include cryotherapy, passive range of motion exercises, massage and therapeutic exercises. Following the initial recovery period, the goals of rehabilitation also include restoring strength, balance and normal gait patterns, as well as recovery of function. During this period the focus of therapy may shift toward therapeutic exercises, aquatic therapy and increasing activity in the animal. Therapeutic modalities such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, photobiomodulation (laser therapy), therapeutic ultrasound and extracorporeal shock wave therapy have been reported to reduce pain and inflammation, enhance healing and reduce recovery time in the early and late stages following orthopaedic surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996106/"}

A search of Medline from 1990 to December 2005, in the domains of functional evaluation, psychometric qualities, functional classification, and health policy in relation to physiotherapy resulted in a list of 1,567 studies. Two reviewers examined the resulting references on the basis of their title and abstract, in order to select the studies that presented data on the psychometric qualities of functional evaluation tests, leading to a final selection of 44 such studies. A selection of functional tests was identified in four major diagnostic groups treated in community physiotherapy: musculoskeletal disorders (including lower back pain), stroke, the elderly, and traumatic brain injuries. The functional tests authors identified essentially cover the body and activities dimension of the ICF. The selected tests could be used as a basis for the standardisation of functional evaluation of the major diagnostic groups treated in community physiotherapy.

All patients performed a standardised sensorimotor training for the glenohumeral joint, which involved, in particular, the glenohumeral and scapulothoracal stabilisers. In this rehabilitation program special proprioceptive exercise tools (body-blade, BOING) were used as well as Tai Chi and aquatic gymnastics. The entire program lasted 4 weeks and was performed and supervised by the same physiotherapist. Prior to and after the program all patients underwent a standardised series of tests. These included the Constant- and the UCLA-Score tests and sensorimotor functions with an angle reproduction test, a threshold to motion test as well as isometric strength testing with a Cybex unit. Prior to the rehabilitation program all subjects showed decreased proprioceptive capabilities. This was particularly evident in the threshold to motion test. After 4 weeks of rehabilitation, significant increases in the Constant- and UCLA-Score tests were found. The sensorimotor test also showed an increased proprioceptive capability especially in the threshold to motion test.

From the outset of treatment, the patient should be encouraged to return to work or other productive activities and should be taught how to be responsible for their own recovery. If passive modalities are used, they must be an adjunct to the active modalities. As soon as the patient is able to continue with an active program without unbearable pain, the passive modalities should be discontinued gradually. If neck pain becomes chronic, the accompanying psychosocial dysfunction must be addressed through behavioral modification techniques, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting. Modification of the work place, work habits, and lifestyles must be emphasized at both the acute and chronic stages. The modalities presented in this article are commonly used by physical therapists. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of most of these modalities has yet to be proved. A literature search on the effectiveness of various physical therapy modalities by Sievers et al showed that only 4% of the studies published from 1979 to 1985 were controlled clinical trials.

Twenty-six final-year physiotherapy students were assigned to two groups of 13 each, one of which received structured training in interviewing skills over a four-week period while the other received no specific instruction. Analyses of the appraisals of pre- and post-test student-patient interviews--the appraisals having been done not only by the students themselves, but by the patients and the independent raters--showed that scores on each evaluation improved significantly following the students' training program.

A prospective observational study was conducted across two metropolitan rehabilitation units in Australia. Twenty-four stroke survivors were observed over three physical therapy sessions. Walking ability was categorized as unassisted or assisted based on Item 5 of the Motor Assessment Scale. Walking practice was categorized as basic or advanced. Steps, duration, intensity and distance walked were measured during physical therapy sessions. Overall, participants took 560 steps (SD 309) over 13min (SD 6) at an intensity of steps 44 steps/min (SD 17) and walked 222m (SD 143) in physical therapy. Unassisted walkers (n=6, 25%) undertook more (or trended towards more) practice of advanced walking than assisted walkers in terms of steps (MD 254 steps, 95% CI 48-462), duration (MD 5min, 95% CI 0-10), intensity (MD 18steps/min, 95% CI -8 to 44) and distance (MD 112m, 95% CI -12 to 236).

The primary goals of the management of neuropathic pain are to detect the underlying cause, to define the differential diagnosis and eliminate risk factors, and to reduce the pain. The physician should also know the functional and psychologic conditions of the patient. Therefore, a multimodal management plan in neuropathic pain is essential. This review aimed to reflect a diverse point of view about various physical therapy modalities and rehabilitation techniques. Physical therapy modalities and rehabilitation techniques are important options and must be considered when pharmacotherapy alone is not sufficient. In addition, psychosocial support and cognitive behavioral therapy could also be taken into consideration.

A total of 201 patients aged 8-15 years old with a postural defect diagnosed by medical examination were enrolled. The analyzed parameters were determined using the DIERS system before the first therapeutic session and after 4 weeks of therapy. The angle of thoracic kyphosis, lateral deviation of the spine and spinal rotation were assessed. The therapy employed techniques associated with the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and Vojta's approaches. The results were analyzed separately for both sexes and for patients rehabilitated solely with Vojta's techniques vs. patients rehabilitated according to combined Vojta's and PNF techniques. The χ2 test was used for statistical analyses, at p < 0.05. There was improvement in the angle of thoracic kyphosis, ranging from 0.14 (among boys with kyphosis < 42°) to 5.47 (among girls with kyphosis ≥ 42°), spinal rotation, from 0.37 (among boys with kyphosis ≥ 42°) to 4.33 (among patients with kyphosis ≥ 42° rehabilitated solely according to Vojta's method), and lateral deviations, ranging from 1.32 mm (among boys with kyphosis < 42°) to 2.99 mm (among patients with kyphosis ≥ 42° rehabilitated solely according to Vojta's method).

The direct access, as opposed to the indirect access which requires a referral from a general physician, has several merits including better quality, timeliness, cost effectiveness of treatment and better probability of preventing acute conditions from turning into chronic ailments. Despite these benefits, several countries including the UAE, do not allow direct access to physiotherapists. This study aims to understand the level of awareness among practicing physiotherapists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) about direct access and to determine whether any of their demographic variables influence the way they perceive the concept. Further, the study sought to explore the perceived barriers and benefits of direct access according to the participating physiotherapists. An observational cross-sectional study was employed. The questionnaire survey developed by Bury and Stokes in 2013 was adapted and employed in this study. The instrument had six sections with close-ended items using a Likert five-point scale to rate them. Two hundred and sixty-four physiotherapists answered the questionnaire shared with them through a web link. Finally, MANOVA was employed to explore any influence of demographic variables on the opinions of the respondents. The findings showed that 70% of participants were aware about direct access while nearly 30% were completely unaware. Younger physiotherapists were more willing to endorse the practice whereas older ones were more apprehensive of the barriers. The main barriers reported were the limited support from the physicians and policy makers, professional autonomy, and the limited scope of practice for the physiotherapists, as well as evidence-based practice. The impact of demographic variables on direct access indicated that physiotherapists under the age of 23 endorsed direct access more strongly than other age groups. More efforts are needed to implement direct access in the UAE, considering the benefits of improved professional status, cost savings, patient satisfaction, and higher efficiency.

Recently the Dutch Health Care Institute constrained their 'list of chronic conditions', and withdrew financial coverage of physiotherapy for elderly persons with haemophilia (PWH). This decision was based on lack of scientific evidence and not being in accordance with 'state of science and practice'. In general, evidence regarding physiotherapy is limited, and especially in rare diseases like haemophilia. 'Evidence based medicine' classifies and recommends evidence based on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, but also means integrating evidence with individual clinical expertise. For the evaluation of physiotherapy - usually individualized treatment - case studies, observational studies and Case Based Reasoning may be more beneficial. Overall annual treatment costs for haemophilia care in the Netherlands are estimated over 100 million Euros, of which 95% is covered by clotting factor concentrates. The cost for physiotherapy assessments in all seven Dutch HTCs (seven centres for adult PWH and seven centres for children) is limited at approximately 500 000 Euros annually. Costs of the actual physiotherapy sessions, carried out in our Dutch first-line care system, will also not exceed 500 000 Euros. Thus, implementation of physiotherapy in haemophilia care the Netherlands in a most optimal way would cost less than 1% of the total budget.

In particular there has been a reduction in focus on the positive features or the upper motor neuron syndrome, such as spasticity, and an increasing emphasis on active, task-related practice of functional tasks. Physical therapy for people with neurological disorders has undergone a paradigm shift as a result of new knowledge about motor control, skill acquisition, and recovery of function after injury. Future research should address new applications of electrical stimulation and whole body vibration as well as the optimal dosage and timing of interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296649/"}

The individual described in this case report is an intercollegiate athlete who, because of chronic LBP, was unable to perform his sport of pole vaulting. The findings of the physical therapy examination suggested that an impairment of lumbar motion prevented the patient from assuming the spinal position necessary for pole vaulting. The goals of the treatment consisted of increasing the patient's lumbar motion to that required for pole vaulting and to have the patient pole vault without pain or stiffness. The treatment approach that was used combined procedures described by Maitland, McKenzie, and others. The rationale for the use of these procedures and their limitations are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1454868/"}

It also should help clarify, however, what decision analysis is not: This is not a practical method for making most decisions in everyday clinical practice. The process of carrying out all the steps in a full, formal analysis is much too time consuming to be applied to the dozens of important decisions clinicians make each day. The method should be used selectively to ensure that the time invested in analysis will pay off in a practical way in practice. Formal analyses should be attempted only for decisions that are made frequently, have important consequences, and provoke some sort of significant controversy, uncertainty, or discontent with the results less formal-decision making achieves. Decision analysis is not a substitute for all other methods of decision making. To suggest that this is the only tool clinicians need would be a little like suggesting that a balanced diet could consist exclusively of broccoli. Intuitive judgments, use of theoretical models, knowledge-problem coupling, and hypothesis-oriented algorithms for clinicians all provide important tools for improving patient care. Often these tools can be combined effectively with decision analysis, but at other times they will be superior on their own. Decision analysis is not an entirely unfamiliar method, and it does not always need to include all component steps to be useful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2500674/"}

Both the groups underwent the same amount of physiotherapy. At the end of the training, only in the EG we observed a significant improvement in constipation, mood, and coping strategies, with regard to social support, as well as in the perception of quality of life (as per SF-12).

Non-surgical treatment should start as soon as possible. The first step is to half or modify sports activities. The treatment includes administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, stretching exercises, and the strengthening of affected muscles. The programme should be adapted to the patient, taking into account the localization and the degree of the injury, as well as his/her sport or work-related activities. The RICE therapeutic programme is important in the treatment of overuse syndromes, especially within the first 72 hours from the occurrence of first symptoms, as it shortens the duration of convalescence for as much as 50%-70%. Beside stabilisation of the joint with optimal loading of antagonistic muscles, stretching exercises have the leading position in prevention and treatment of overuse injuries. During rehabilitation, it is necessary to change activity, its duration and intensity. When a person successfully resumes its sports activities with full load, the rehabilitation is considered completed. No surgical or non-surgical method can warrant a hundred percent recovery for any localization of overuse injury.

{"id": "28509604", "title": "Moving forth: Imagining physiotherapy education differently.", "text": "Contemporary and future physiotherapists are, and will be, presented with challenges different to their forebears. Yet, physiotherapy tends to remain tied to historical ways of seeing the world: these are passed down to generations of physiotherapy graduates. These historical perspectives privilege particular knowledge and skills so that students gain competency for graduation. However, contemporary practice is inherently more complex than the focus on knowledge and skills would have us believe. Professional life requires students to develop the capability to deal with uncertain and diverse futures. This paper argues that physiotherapy needs to think differently about entry-level education; the focus on knowledge and competencies that has been the mainstay in physiotherapy education must now be understood in the context of an education that embraces knowing, doing, being. Two educational frameworks are offered in support of this argument - threshold concepts and ways of thinking and practicing (WTP). Taken together, these ideas can assist physiotherapy to think in fresh ways about disciplinary learning. Threshold concepts and WTP help to understand the nature of a discipline: its behaviors, culture, discourses, and methods. By interrogating the discursive aspects of the discipline, physiotherapy educators will be better placed to provide more relevant preparation for practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28509604/"}

These are shared opinions. In fact there is scientific evidence showing that the mental simulation of an action is correlated to a subliminal activation of the motor system. There is also evidence that virtual stimulation can enhance the acquisition of simple motor sequences. In some situations, virtual training was found to be as beneficial as real training and more beneficial than workbook and no training in teaching complex motor skills to people with learning disabilities. Moreover, studies of brain-injured hemiplegics patients suggest that these patients retain the ability to generate accurate motor images even of actions that they cannot perform. Combined with evidence indicating that motor imagery and motor planning share common neural mechanisms, these observations suggest that supporting mental imagery through non-immersive, low-cost virtual reality (VR) applications may be a potentially effective intervention in the rehabilitation of brain-injured patients. Starting from this background, our goal is to design and develop a new technique for the acquisition of new motor abilities- \"imagery enhanced learning\" (or I-learning)-to be used in neuro-psychological rehabilitation. A key feature of I-learning is the use of potentially low-cost, Virtual Reality enhanced technology to facilitate motor imagery creating a compelling sense of presence. This paper will discuss the rationale and a preliminary rehabilitation protocol for investigating mental imagery as a means of promoting motor recovery in patients with a neurological disorder. The treatment strategy aims at evoking powerful imaginative responses using an innovative technique which makes no attempt to simulate the real-world motor behavior, but draws the patient's attention to its underlying dynamic structure. This is done by displaying highly stylized sketches of the motor behavior on a computer screen and gradually increasing the perceptual realism of the visualization. This strategy assumes that optimal learning will be achieved when the patient is allowed to elaborate his own schema and sequences of movements, thereby constructing his own personal image of the motor behavior to be trained.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14511455/"}

Background Recent evolutions in health care delivery are putting physical therapists in the forefront to be more responsible for providing high-quality rehabilitation care in a more cost-effective manner. Studies investigating the association between physical therapy visit utilization and outcomes in vulnerable patient populations following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may provide useful insights. Objectives To examine the relationship between patient age, sex, physical therapy visit utilization, and physical therapy intervention charges with revision rates and patient-reported outcomes in individuals following primary ACL reconstruction. Methods A sample of 660 patients who had an ACL reconstruction was identified through an electronic medical record database. Age and physical therapy visit utilization were categorized to examine effects between groups (20 years of age or younger, 21 to 34 years of age, 35 years of age or older; fewer than 9 visits, 9 to 14 visits, 15 or more visits). Multilevel mixed-effects linear models were conducted to compare differences between revision rates and patient-reported outcomes during the episode of care. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were also used to determine visit-number and charge-per-visit cut points to discriminate patients who achieved at least a minimal clinically important difference on the patient-reported outcomes. Results Of 660 patients, 22 (3.3%) had revision surgery. Compared with patients 20 years and younger, the incidence rate ratio of ACL reconstruction revision was lower in patients who were 35 years and older (85%) and 21 to 34 years (59%). Of 470 patients who attended physical therapy for longer than 3 months, change in Knee Outcome Survey activities of daily living subscale score was significantly lower among patients 20 years of age and younger and in the lowest visit category. Conclusion Achievement of favorable outcomes following ACL reconstruction may require categorization of patients beyond surgical diagnosis alone. Younger patients (aged 20 years or less) attending fewer physical therapy visits (fewer than 9) were more likely to have ACL revision surgery and had inferior patient-reported outcomes compared to older patients and those with higher physical therapy visit utilization. The study design of a retrospective cohort limits the ability to identify causal relationships. Additionally, this study was conducted in only 1 geographic region within a single health care delivery system, which may limit the generalizability of the results.

The treatment method is based on the assumption that pain and pain disability are not only influenced by somatic pathology, if found, but also by psychological and social factors. A recent study highlighted the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral interventions, as compared to no treatment, for chronic low back patients. However, to the authors' knowledge, there is no randomized controlled trial that evaluates a behavioral program for patients following lumbar disc surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral graded activity (BGA) program compared to usual care (UC) in physiotherapy following first-time lumbar disc surgery. The BGA program was a patient-tailored intervention based upon operant therapy. The essence of the BGA is to teach patients that it is safe to increase activity levels. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Assessments were carried out before and after treatment by an observer blinded to treatment allocation. Patients suffering residual symptoms restricting their activities of daily living and/or work at the 6 weeks post-surgery consultation by the neurosurgeon were included. The exclusion criteria were: complications during surgery, any relevant underlying pathology, and any contraindication to physiotherapy or the BGA program. Primary outcome measures were the patient's Global Perceived Effect and the functional status. Secondary measures were: fear of movement, viewing pain as extremely threatening, pain, severity of the main complaint, range of motion, and relapses. Physiotherapists in the BGA group received proper training. Between November 1997 and December 1999, 105 patients were randomized; 53 into the UC group and 52 into the BGA group. The unadjusted analysis shows a 19.3% (95% CI: 0.1 to 38.5) statistically significant difference to the advantage of the UC group on Global Perceived Effect. This result, however, is not robust, as the adjusted analyses reveal a difference of 15.7% (95% CI: -3.9 to 35.2), which is not statistically significant. For all other outcome measures there were no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between the two intervention groups. In general, the physiotherapists' compliance with the BGA program was satisfactory, although not all treatments, either in the BGA or the UC group, were delivered exactly as planned, resulting in less contrast between the two interventions than had been planned for. There was one re-operation in each group. The BGA program was not more effective than UC in patients following first-time lumbar disc surgery. For Global Perceived Effect there was a borderline statistically significant difference to the advantage of the UC group. On functional status and all other outcome measures there were no relevant differences between interventions. The number of re-operations was negligible, indicating that it is safe to exercise after first-time disc surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14505118/"}

The time spent in active practice is fundamental. The purpose of this study was to analyse what was the actual amount of exercise and content of the performed exercise of the three-week gait-oriented physiotherapy program for chronic stroke patients in an in-patient setting. Twenty ambulatory post-stroke patients participated in an in-patient rehabilitation period during which a special effort was made to enhance gait training and the amount of therapy and its contents were recorded in structured form. Baseline and postintervention gait ability assessments were made, but the analysis concentrated on participation records in different forms of therapy. Patients received 19 hours of instructed physiotherapy in three weeks and together with self-initiated training they practised for 28 hours. The practice time in the upright position was 62% of the total duration of the instructed physiotherapy and 35% was performed while sitting. This amount of exercise resulted in improvement of the gait tests. In order to improve gait in the chronic state of disease, a sufficient amount of gait rehabilitation practice can be obtained with a combination of electromechanical gait trainer exercises, physiotherapy, instructed exercise groups and self-initiated training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15083291/"}

Physical medicine and rehabilitation has always been a discipline with own methods, issues, and own areas of research and theory. The treatment techniques of this specialty are summarized under the term \"physiotherapy\". Its methods, which also contain balneology and medical climatology, are using physical and physiological principles of order in the organism. The application of this therapy happens for the training of impaired functions, influence of pathogenetic processes causing pain, and for the activation of the body's regeneration capacities. Physiotherapy is not limited to certain diseases or stages of illness but may prevent, abolish, or weaken malregulation of functional units, especially when used in repetitions. A particular focus of the rehabilitation is to address the still remaining functional reserves of an injured organism in a way that a compensation can be reached as close a possible to the etiological point of the pathogenetic chain of causes. Declared goal of the physiotherapy is the induction and optimization of healing processes. Due to this interdisciplinary approach, physical and rehabilitation medicine is an essential part for almost every medical subspecialty.

This survey of clinicians aimed to describe standard (usual) care after total knee replacement in Australia and to provide possible explanations for practice variance, if such variation exists. A nationwide postal survey involving public and privately funded hospital physiotherapy departments was conducted. Purposive sampling was used to randomly select hospitals from the National Joint Replacement Registry. A series of closed and open-ended protocol-based questions were asked. A response rate of 65% (65/100) was obtained. Elements of consistency and diversity across the acute and post-acute phases were evident. Consistent findings included the provision of gait retraining and exercise prescription in the acute period, the requirement for independent ambulation as a criterion for discharge from acute care and the routine referral to ongoing outpatient or community-based physiotherapy. Less consistency was reported for the use of continuous passive motion and cryotherapy in the acute phase, the modes of ongoing rehabilitation, discharge from rehabilitation criteria and the tools for measuring outcomes. Both institutional and non-institutional factors appeared to explain the demonstrated practice variation.

Women, older respondents, non-smokers and those who exercised for 30 minutes at least once a week were more likely to use osteopathy/chiropractic. The only other significant predictor of physiotherapy use was desire for more physical exercise. While those reporting back pain had Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scores suggesting very significant levels ofdisability, respondents with back pain who consulted osteopaths/chiropractors reported better health in all dimensions of the SF-36 than those using physiotherapy services. Although they reported worse pain scores than people not consulting any practitioners, their mental health, physical functioning, energy and health perception were better. It is impossible to disentangle cause and effect in this cross-sectional study, but the data suggest that people who can afford to pay are more likely to choose osteopath/chiropractor treatments than physiotherapy.

It is important that any health care provider perceive the patient as a person who happens to have arthritis--not as 'an \"arthritic\".' Defining a person by one's disease process is dehumanizing. The patient has the same aspirations as anyone who is ablebodied--to be free from disease. While the patient may know that a cure is not imminent, there is still the hope for one. Therefore, as the patient comes for physiotherapy, there may be a hidden wish that the moist packs, TENS, or therapeutic pool will be curative. It is important that the patient understand that no equipment in the physiotherapy department has curative powers. This will help avoid unnecessary dependency behaviours on the part of the patient. Careful instruction and supervision of the patient by the physiotherapist, in concert with reinforcement from the physician, can prepare the patient to apply heat, cold, or a variety of treatments at home. Although the patient is given the responsibility for this part of his care, periodic follow-up and reassessment should be completed to determine changes in his physiological, psychological, and functional status.

The measurements were made in a random order with both machines. The results showed that the two isokinetic machines gave quite different results in trunk flexion-extension strength measurements. A statistically significant difference was present in the average peak torques between the two devices, with the exception of flexion at low angular velocity (60 degrees/s), and the correlations between the two measurements were low. The results were assumed to be more of a reflection of the interdevice variations (hardware and software, attachment of the subject) than of learning effects or other phenomena.

We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We also performed a systematic literature search of the economic evidence. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation because there was insufficient clinical evidence. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke, we spoke with people who had been diagnosed with stroke, as well as their caregivers. We did not find any published studies that met the specific clinical inclusion criteria. We did not identify any studies that compared the cost-effectiveness of continual long-term versus short-term physiotherapy after stroke. The budget impact of publicly funding continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from $445,000 in year 1 at an uptake rate of 8% to $888,000 in year 5 at an uptake rate of 16%. The people who had been diagnosed with stroke with whom we spoke reported that they had benefitted from continual long-term physiotherapy.

We estimate that publicly funding continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke in Ontario would result in additional costs of between $445,000 and $888,000 annually over the next 5 years. Patients and caregivers who we spoke with felt that patients who have experienced a stroke should be able to continue with physiotherapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194882/"}

The effective value of functional electrical stimulation, especially for the lower limbs, seems to be proved in some patients with upper motor neuron lesions. However, a clear definition of patient selection criteria has not been given yet, while a comparison with the results with vibratory techniques is still be carried out. With regard to the so-called electrotherapy of denervated muscles. it has been stressed that the trophic state can also be promoted by vibratory mechanical stimulation while the electrical stimulation could partly reduce the diffuse type of membrane excitability present in the devervated muscle fibres; this effect might interfere negatively with the process of collateral nerve sprouting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6966219/"}

We collected data from 21 participants through semistructured interviews which were analyzed using the Colaizzi approach. Two main themes emerged: quality related to the professional and structure of the care system. Perceptions about the care received from the physiotherapist are influenced by factors such as communication, the way they treat the patient, and the trust established between patient and professional. In addition, structural aspects such as allocation of spaces, technical equipment and rehabilitation devices, access to centers, and the availability of the physiotherapist affect satisfaction and the perception of the quality of the service received. As it occurs in other health services provided by different health-care professionals, the quality of physiotherapy care is related to subjective (relational) and objective (structural) perceptions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669428/"}

Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. Women with primary dysmenorrhea. Any form of physiotherapy treatment. The primary outcome was menstrual pain intensity and the secondary outcome was quality of life. The search yielded 222 citations. Of these, 11 were eligible randomised trials and were included in the review. Meta-analysis revealed statistically significant reductions in pain severity on a 0-10 scale from acupuncture (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9) and acupressure (weighted mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9), when compared to a control group receiving no treatment. However, these are likely to be placebo effects because when the control groups in acupuncture/acupressure trials received a sham instead of no treatment, pain severity did not significantly differ between the groups. Significant reductions in pain intensity on a 0-10 scale were noted in individual trials of heat (by 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.7), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (2.3, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.2), and yoga (3.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 4.2). Meta-analysis of two trials of spinal manipulation showed no significant reduction in pain. None of the included studies measured quality of life. Physiotherapists could consider using heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and yoga in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. While benefits were also identified for acupuncture and acupressure in no-treatment controlled trials, the absence of significant effects in sham-controlled trials suggests these effects are mainly attributable to placebo effects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24856936/"}

The aims of this review of clinical trials were to evaluate the safety and the effects on physiologic and clinical outcomes of airway clearance techniques (ACTs) and rehabilitation in NCFB patients, in comparison to usual care. The search was performed on March 2018 by using PubMed and PeDro databases. 33 studies were selected. The use of ACTs for NCFB were effective in increasing sputum volume although no benefit in quality of life (QoL) or pulmonary exacerbations were observed. There were no differences in effectiveness between the several techniques used. Humidification and saline inhalation were able to aid airway clearance. Hypertonic solution (HS) was more effective than isotonic solutions (IS) in improving expectoration and sputum viscosity. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) was found to be associated with short term benefits in exercise capacity, dyspnea and fatigue. Exercise training seems to improve quality of life and lower exacerbation rate, but long-term data are not available. Further studies are necessary to identify the most feasible long-term outcomes such as QoL and exacerbation rate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32072797/"}

A 3month baseline of usual therapy was compared to a 3-month trial which involved an implementation team consisting of a physiotherapist and a rehabilitation engineer supporting a new rehabilitation device being used in clinical practice. Therapists were free to use the Andago for therapy. The patient progressed from non-ambulatory during baseline to walking with single-person assistance by trial end. There was a higher proportion of therapy dedicated to walking when comparing baseline to trial phases, and when comparing Andago and usual therapy within the trial phase. However, therapists reported increased perceived strain and fatigue during Andago-assisted sessions. Therapist engagement with the Andago was moderate, with the device utilized in approximately one out of five sessions per week. The implementation team enabled safe and supported uptake of the novel device which was valued by the case study participant and their therapist. Findings suggest the Andago's potential to enhance gait training but highlight the need to address usability challenges and staff burden to optimize integration and adoption in clinical practice. We believe this can be addressed by better integration of clinicallyoriented engineers in the delivery of rehabilitation services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40644053/"}

The second group (PT) had daily physical therapy including hot pack and short wave diathermy application. Both groups concluded their treatments with stretching exercises and were also instructed to a daily home exercise program. The primary end point of the study was to reach 80% of the normal passive range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder in all planes within a period of two weeks. Secondary end points were the overall ROM and pain response (spontaneous pain, night pain and pain with motion) to each treatment. 19 patients in the CYR group (95%) and 13 patients in the PT group (65%) reached sufficient ROM at the end of the second week (p <0.05). The improvement in shoulder flexion, inner and outer rotation values and the decrease in pain with motion were significantly better in the CYR group after the first week of treatment. The Cyriax method of rehabilitation provides a faster and better response than the conventional physical therapy methods in the early phase of treatment in adhesive capsulitis.
