      "text": "Insomnia is a highly prevalent, often debilitating, and economically burdensome form of sleep disturbance caused by various situational, medical, emotional, environmental and behavioral factors. Although several consensually-derived nosologies have described numerous insomnia phenotypes, research concerning these phenotypes has been greatly hampered by a lack of widely accepted operational research diagnostic criteria (RDC) for their definition. The lack of RDC has, in turn, led to inconsistent research findings for most phenotypes largely due to the variable definitions used for their ascertainment.",

      "text": "Sleep disorders are very prevalent in the general population and are associated with significant medical, psychological, and social disturbances. Insomnia is the most common. When chronic, it usually reflects psychological/behavioral disturbances. Most insomniacs can be evaluated in an office setting, and a multidimensional approach is recommended, including sleep hygiene measures, psychotherapy, and medication. The parasomnias, including sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares, have benign implications in childhood but often reflect psychopathology or significant stress in adolescents and adults and organicity in the elderly. Excessive daytime sleepiness is typically the most frequent complaint and often reflects organic dysfunction.",

Method A representative UK sample (non-institutionalised, &gt; 14 years old) was interviewed by telephone ( n =4972; 79.6% participation rate) with the Sleep-EVAL system. Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the network structures and centrality indices of shift and non-shift workers using network analysis and network comparison test. Participants included 1339 hospital employees, where 542 were shift workers and 797 were non-shift workers. Overall, a significant difference between network structures were observed. In particular, daytime dysfunction emerged as a strongly connected symptom in shift workers, as evidenced by strength centrality.",
