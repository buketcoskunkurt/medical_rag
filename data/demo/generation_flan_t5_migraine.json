An indwelling forearm catheter was used to sample blood at 90‐min intervals for a total of 120 h, which included 88 h of sustained sleeplessness, in 10 healthy men. The diurnal amplitude of leptin was reduced during total sleep deprivation and returned toward normal during the period of recovery sleep. This finding provides evidence that sleep influences the nocturnal leptin profile, and may have implications for the understanding of the role of sleep in metabolic regulation and the aetiologies of obesity and the night eating syndrome.",
